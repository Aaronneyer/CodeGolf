KhUJX_0L7Mf-iArcFaTpAg : Overpriced. Bad food. No parking around. Gets one star just for being large and always having a table open (could this possibly have anything to do with the above mentioned qualities?)  I tried the "Yummy" and will admit it's not bad but it's definitely a try only once in your life kinda dish..
2RJcGfZj65P3eg9XX5pV7Q : FISH TACOS AND VEGGIE BURRITOS!  That's all I really have to say about this place.  Both are very good! ^_^
UJclJ9I3mFwi1Ew7VWTrCg : This place is great. I've been here for meetings, to get work done, to hang out with friends, and on dates, and it's fit the bill every time. In the summer, there's a wonderful patio, and in the winter it's cozy and warm. All the food I've had is delicious -- especially the salad dressing!
KEU5rT_0uc0nXey1am4zAw : A very friendly, delicious sandwich shop.  The staff are very nice and seem genuinely interested in making you a nice sandwich.  They're made fresh as you order them, but don't take long at all to arrive at your table.  The sandwiches themselves taste great.  The bread is good, but there is a LOT of bread relative to sandwich.  I don't know where they get their bread, but it is some thick stuff.  I had to peel it down to make it thin enough to fit in my mouth.  Free food for the crows and pigeons, I guess.
2CfhJv1S8-hibU3XsR_htQ : 3 stars = A-OK  Don't get me wrong, the cupcakes are nice and moist, but I can't seem to justify spending $3.50 on one cupcake but then again, that's why it's in La Jolla haha.    Anyways, the line can get pretty long so make sure you have someone that can spot you while you head over to Flame Broiler for something worth 2 cupcakes or less.
a-7O8NeVTKQo2JVzoanS6A : I really loved this place when I lived up in Morningside; Recently, I've ridden the train from Brooklyn to get their delicious pasta dishes, generous entrees, and creative specials. I always thought their brick oven pizzas stood out. Someone in that kitchen can surely cook.  Unfortunately, I have had quite a few incidents of flat-out abyssmal service that has left a lingering bad taste in my mouth. Never before had I witnessed service that was OPENLY HOSTILE, forget lackluster or inattentive. There is literally no food worth the discomfort Sezz Medi's waitstaff (often) induces.   One time the contention between my family (party of 4) and the waitress had grown so great that she included a 19% gratuity charge on the bill ahead of what surely would have been a tip confrontation.   It's a rare place that can serve delicious food at affordable prices in Manhattan, and it's a shame that Sezz Medi's waitstaff squanders that distinction.
e0nSjmM8BObGHCOEm1IAqA : It was the crappiest day of the year and I needed a warm meal that was Picante. I went into the Border Cafe for lunch and the place was dead.  I got a great table by the winows and the nice waitress appeared instantly. There were about 4 other tables so she really din't have anything else to do. She was nice and brought some watery but good salsa and some excellent chips.  I looked over the menu and decided on a enchillada and taco combo.  The chicken toaco was okay not bad but the enchillada waschessey and wonderful. I made a really stupid error and ordered a cup of coffee.  DO NOT ORDER THE COFFEE it sucks but what the fuck was I thinking I was in a tex-mex place.  I guess I was expecting sa New Orleans chicory kind of coffe but I got a Boston brown piss in a cup.  Thi was the only bad part and it was frankly my own damn fault! The service was great, the food good and not overly pricey.  I wish I had re-fried beans but at least they were balck beans the rice was od but i think it was the "cajun" element.  I will go back.
ryLxTuG-XvmO46fkCoD9RA : Good food, but slow service.  We waited for our waiter for over 45 mins, and it took over 2 hours to get our food-this is with reservations.  Try the pinapple fried rice, its great and will make the wait worth it. :-)
gTF5Ew3UnLWog96UN2jQdA : The pork products here are unreal. The pulled pork sandwich as well as the deli ham and Italian combo sandwiches are serious nom nom nom nom! Their bacon is ridiculously good too. It's best to come here early. They sell out of everything by early afternoon. Highly recommended.
FGrRClxehFA71kJBK082og : Adieu, eve!  Was there on the very last night as the restaurant closed 1/16/11.  Grilled flank steak was perfect, grilled vegetables were superlative, and service was very attentive.  Eve hovered around in her chef's coat among the cloud of regulars holding the wake at the bar.  Ginger-lime martini, I will Miss You!  Looking forward to being a regular at Frita Batidos on Washington.
1hPxFOmxIOSvHLQp72NWlA : pretty much my favorite place in Kendall square. Hands down.
9I2nPfV8s3uaAAftOoCNTg : Finally decent sushi in CP!!  And the bubble tea gives Ten Ren's a run for it's money.  Location-wise (and menu-wise) this place beats Ten Ren's - it's much easier to find parking.  Seating isn't great so I'll most likely be doing drive-bys to pick up bubble tea on the go.
enaO2IIq_eM-GiOX1gmtIg : My experience at Hermann Park is limited to a wedding I went to in the Chinese Gazebo.  It was gorgeous.  The gazebo itself was too small for the amount of guests, but we all had a good time crammed in there.  It was such a perfect day for an outdoor wedding too--not too humid, a slight breeze, and nice and sunny.    The park is kept well manicured so there isn't much to complain about.  There were a lot of people roaming around without it being too crowded.  The parking is awful though, but since it is in the middle of the city, you can't really complain.    Going to this park makes me wish I had a dog.  It is the perfect place to just talk a walk while feeling completely safe (unheard of in such a large city).
t0QA_-4p8-greFyJRovV3w : How can anyone give two stars to a cupcakery??  That person must also hate fuzzy newborn kitties!!  I do!  I hate cats. They're vicious and they scratch. And they also tend to have rotten attitudes. Have a gander at what I posted about cats under "Don't tell anyone else but..." on my profile. Go ahead. I'll wait.  Kara's Cupcakes deserves a two star rating because the Yelp gods have deemed two stars to equate "Meh. I've experienced better." And that I have.  Kara's cupcakes are not moist enough. Need there be any more explanation? More butter in the batter, please. No one likes a dry cupcake. Especially not at $3.25 a pop. Psh. Still a Sprinkles girl.
IWqc1YneiXXNmxgAg7Ykag : I bought a bike off of craig's list and took it to Lion's the following day for a tune-up because it is an older bike and the ride wasn't so smooth.  They finished within 3 hours and charged me $21.95.  The bike rides great now!  I am very satisfied with my service here and will keep coming back as needed. (P.S. this occurred toward the end of the semester when business is slow.)  Also, if you have the option... go to Lion's bike shop and not to the bike shop in the UV.  That shop is shady and a ripoff.
fcjSPwkzhhVCmX-fUwRiZw : Best pizza on franklin st
13d0Q9EkbetZzZLc4vdKjQ : Moving, Educational, Informative. Great Museum. Great Events. Love the diversity of "World Art" that is presented.  I loved El Anaatsui's shimmering quilts made of bottle caps, the exhibit of the Tuareg, the exhibit of Mardi Gras Costumes, and many others.  Also a good blend of old as well as cutting edge new art.
LRYYCBtPs1dCGgtcQIA-ig : A small pizza shack that creates good pizza. Strictly take-out or delivery.  They also have a good selection of subs and sandwiches.  Their hot wings are also pretty good, not the best in town, but definitely worth trying.
jKiPO94spn3HiXj6YiUWlw : i think people give this place too much credit. it is definitely a cheap after lunch/dinner sweet fix but i wouldn't come back. i was really excited to come here especially hearing all the great reviews on yelp and from my friends, but when i got here i wasn't blown away. there's really nothing to rave about except for the prices but if you think about how much gas you spend as well as the parking and the amount of time spent overall, it's really not all that. plus, the service is pretty crumby. ( one of the employees yelled at me for taking a photo!) i really didn't think that it was necessary for him to yell at me for something so little. anyways, it really is a nice treat if you LIVE in the area or actually in the area and have a purpose besides trying diddy riese.
sa-31yVNoSsHx1g9iK39Zg : Love the cult-juice this place serves up. In fact, it's the best Yerba Mate we've found North of Philly. The Mate Factor is the most unique place to stop off at while in Ithaca. The drink, here, is the highlight, so don't invest too much in the food. There's better and cheaper in Ithaca. Stop in, say "wow this place is crazy", then get your mate and go chill in the commons.  The Mate Factor is right inside the Ithaca Commons, so it's hard to miss, and makes for a great place to start out any day in Ithaca with. Not sure what some of these peeps issues are with cults, but I highly suggest this place over and over to everyone on a trip into the North-East.
RZDqlE_z2vc1-7Wl8yM0Qw : I was skeptical about this place - if you just pop your head in, it looks like a tiny salad bar with not much else going for it. But I finally came in for the falafel sandwich meal (thank you Munch on Me), and it was nothing short of a culinary revelation. seriously.  Their belgian fries were literally the best fries I've had in my entire life, and I'm willing to stake my (admittedly paltry) reviewing reputation on that. They were crunchy and golden on the outside, softer on the inside, and the perfect size for dipping. They don't even need salt!   I've never been a huge fan of falafel, but theirs were incredible. Like the fries, they were crisp on the outside and moist on the inside, and so full of flavor! Totally unlike any other falafel I've ever had. The rest of the sandwich wasn't overshadowed, either - the pita was the perfect medium softness, the hummus was well seasoned, and you basically can't go wrong with the salad bar toppings. Tahini sauce, cilantro sauce, whatever. It's delicious.  It may be a bit more expensive than I like to spend on a quick lunch, but they are definitely generous enough that you can share or save some for the best midnight snack ever. I'll be back tomorrow for the rice pudding...
fqtecjWBU83jnx2brDm5mw : I've been going to Geoff's for at least 12+ years- even followed it around Thayer Street as it switched locations. I'm not as fond of the Benefit Street location- now the sole locale since '08, but hey, I freakin' love this place. You want fancy food, kiss-ass customer service, clean tables, and A/C that works? Go elsewhere.   The sandwiches here are diverse, creatively composed and named, and they don't skimp on any ingredients. Take a few minutes to linger over the chalkboard menu and giggle at the names, but know exactly what you want when you step up to the counter, because staff does not suffer fools gladly.   Yes, prices are a little high, and you may have to wipe down your own table and chair before eating. But you can bet your ass I'll be grabbing a cold, crunchy delicious pickle from the open barrel- and yes, I will take my Rocky on a roll with an extra side of surly, please!
4TSdbAbGvtX0QNGpnB7fIQ : Probably the best NY style pizza in Ithaca.  But thats not saying too much.  Its no pizza my heart, but  good enough to satiate a pizza craving.  On a side note the best pizza is ordered by the slice from a counter and reheated.
hoq9X39nRLKXmFiC9qQqwQ : I am all about customer service and was SO disappointed when I came here on a night out with my husband.  The girls behind the counter barely acknowleged our presence, as they chatted about boys and clothes, and the grimey details of their pre-college lives.  Incredibly annoying considering their appearance and the fact that they were making our drinks.  I expected more, as we have never been treated rudely at this joint before.
HAJ2On-Zk8zM4iOkyNEOug : Beautiful hotel. Got a groupon for stay and dinner so my fiancé and I took advantage for a staycation. Friendly staff nice room good amenities. Breakfast is made to order. Only downside was they have a fruitfly problem In the bar and the restaurant. Get that fixed and you'll get 5 stars
S6UP8C56VSc3VMk5SO92cA : My first experience with Antonio's was many years ago at their Amherst location late night after a show. It was some of the best pizza I had ever had (of course when you're starving and have had a few too many, of course it will seem like that). Little did I know there was also an Antonio's down in Providence. Of course by the time I got around to trying their Thayer location I had built them up so much in my head.   Over the years I've been to the Thayer location a handful of times, and each time I'm just a little disappointed. The pizza is tasty, but always gives me some bad indigestion. I love the creative gourmet choices in the pie, and for the money you get pretty decent portions. Though, if you're like me and can easily eat three pieces, you might as well just go ahead and order a whole pizza.  Antonio's is good if you want something hot & quick either for a light afternoon lunch or a late-nite snack, but thats about it.
f0EblbRBwPgv1dFqv1Ia0w : They don't have the biggest selection, but for the only store of its kind on UM's campus, it's a good one-stop shop for your sexytime and bachelorette party needs. It's a comfortable place for most people, especially those who might be freaked out by a sex store in the first place. What I REALLY like about this store is the owner and the staff. The staff knows what they're talking about and they're helpful and courteous. The owner gives sex talks around campus, and she's great. She's extremely knowledgeable and makes you feel really comfortable talking about sex. She talks about stuff like sex toys and lube but also about the really important stuff--safe sex! From their website: "BethAnn Karmeisool teaches all seminars. Ms. Karmeisool is a certified sexual health educator who has dedicated her life to encourage responsible behavior. She has owned and operated S3 Safe Sex Store since its creation in 1995."
MRW8KJLB4lTomlaBc_v6yg : This Chow Fun group newbie is a re-tooled XO Steak and Chop. This joins the littany of Brasserie's popping up in P-town. It is relatively inespensive and offers what you would expect from nouveau Francois cuisine.   The have some kitschy touches like stamping the paper linens while you order drinks. The service is fantastic, and the decor is XO...almost exactly.  Food was good, but not mind blowing with the exception of the chica's fettucini which was out standing, Steak Frites were ok but not even top 3 in town, but my bud;s short rib was reportedly outstanding.  Another choice for Bras type grub, but with so many in the city, this is not a standout.
XLlUJeS8sSDRLXnbWTGGNQ : This place is awsome mulitas are a must. I wouldn't recommend it on a weekend it gets soo full the salsa bar gets out of control long lines.  What truly sets this place aside is their homemade tortillas. They make them as you watch. The ingredients are good and since it's on that strip of restaurants near USC it the area has improved.  I recommend you try any thing with al pastor meat if you eat pork if you don't try it any way I never eat red meat  but the mulitas alpastor do it for me I just think of of as a large four legged turkey.   By the way I tried their other location in South Gate not even close to this  one greasy soggy just a bad experience I only endose this one.
DejQZNAYidhj5dfHTlr4og : I would definitely recommend this place for a sandwich at lunch or otherwise. Good falafel sanwiches--Meghan's and the Falafel with Taboulei are my favorites. Their french fries are really good too.  They are really inexpensive, also. One of the few places in ann arbor that you can get a really decent lunch for under 6 bucks.
dP5MHn3e9LLiwlGDQ-NLug : This place is awesome, and blows Cosmic (Cantina) out of the park.    It's hidden, requiring you to descend steps to even see it.  They have great lunch combos, great service, and friendly staff.  There's a salsa bar in the back room.  I've never been charged for extra sour cream (which is truly a necessity), and offer great burritos and enchiladas.  Highly recommended for tar heels craving a mex-fix before their 1:00pm MWF (or the dreaded 12:15 TR classes ).  Never a bad experience here.    1.  Unlimited chips & salsa = awesome 2.  Margaritas are on point!   3.  Decently priced (barato) without compromising quality of the food. 4.  Hit up the burritos / enchiladas, you won't be disappointed.
AR8yzQFuQTCWXsynveUJ5w : The only sausage-fest that I'll ever walk out of bearing a smile.     :)
kHjgT6hJqtYeZTYDrSNDEQ : An ok restaurant with your typical Irish pub attached to the side of it.  A nice option if you can't decide whether to keep it informal with some burgers and beers and watch the Red Sox on their projection set-up, or get some privacy in their dining room.  The food is pretty middle of the road -- nothing exciting and nothing that bad either.  Though some of their specials (usually seafood stuff like muscles and shrimp) do look good if you're willing to risk 15  bucks.  You might be pleasently suprised.  Or not.   I stick to the pub scene here and go with burgers and sandwiches.  Like I said, not the best burgers you'll get, but they get the job done.  They go the thick steak fry route, which isn't bad either.  I'd stay away from the apps though.  We got the combo platter once and it was a regrettable choice.  As a side note, they do a trivia night on Tuesdays at 6:30pm which I'd give three stars to as well.  It's through the Stump! organization so it's not as good as others, but it's at a good time -- usually over by 8pm or so.
cACmWn5JcHfyQyYeb-j7-g : We have been to Max a few times before for brunch, dinner, or drinks.  Normally not a tough critic, but our most recent visit to Max was lacking.  Service was basically horrible.  We both ordered breakfast at the same time.  My boyfriend's frittata came out first, fine...thought they were still working on my french toast, but after 5-10 minutes realized there was no french toast coming for me.  Server never checked in...had to hunt her down for water and to order my food again.  Mind you the restaurant was empty.  Waited another 10 minutes for the french toast, and had to ask again where my food was while the server lounged at the bar eating pizza.  Only plus, the french toast was really  tasty and we enjoy the laid back atmosphere.
TtgPLN5ZWi6iwaAlkGZ1EA : Sara's lovely. She's makes every visit relaxing, enjoyable, and simply..fun. I typically only get an eyebrow wax every 4 weeks but even those 20 minutes spent are escape enough. By far, my most consistent and sweet esthetician yet! I never feel as though she's rushed, and she always ensures that I'm happy. What more can a girl ask for?  Thanks Sara!
oaKKyvXZPRnCjlBf-dn2NQ : This place was pretty good. I eat alot of authentic Vietnamese noodles on NYC and Le's ranked up there. I shared a few noodle dishes with friends and all were excellent. My only complaint is that the food was a bit greasy.
X0LXC8JoB5oHsaXE2J0eAg : I finally made it over here the other night after reading the tons of gushing reviews and, yes, it was absolutely delicious. Appetizers, cocktails, entrees, service -- all top-notch.  All the tables were booked until 9pm on a Wednesday night, but my group of three lucked out and we managed to snag one of the two tables in the bar section around 7:45.   I had the number 43 cocktail (rye, port, maple syrup, bitters - "our take on the old fashioned," explained our waitress) before dinner, which was great - lots of flavor, not too sweet, and served with one giant, very attractive ice cube.  The country ham starter with "angel biscuits" was delicious - thinly sliced, melt-in-your-mouth ham that's a lot closer to serrano ham or prosciutto than canadian bacon served wtih a spicy, delicious jam and tiny, flakey biscuits.    I had the roasted chicken as a main course. I'm not sure what magic went into making it so good -- "butter," my friend speculated -- but it was amazing. Crispy, salty skin on the outside with juicy inside. Truly awesome.  After dinner, another cocktail, the number 47 (applejack, aperol, and bourbon), and the included-with-the-check cookie bits.  Service was great also - friendly and attentive even though the place was totally packed. Total was almost $130 after tip for three people, so it's not an everyday kind of thing, but it was a great meal with great drinks. I can't wait to go again.
EpMH0JipilxAXEtJ-7KbAA : Great food and very affordable prices...can get crowded though.  Lots of options on menu, I will be back.
YLTeh_ywINwURBtEpkkpaw : huh.  So this was Providence's Thayer Street.   Can't say that there was a big welcome on a late afternoon.   The attitude from the staff was hysterical.   The food was mysterious and expensive.  Bathrooms could have been cleaner.
95iUagnbLQPZN1RujyIJRA : Sometimes you just need some chocolate to brighten your day, and when that moment seizes you hopefully you'll be near Kara's. The store is very inviting: it's pink and sparsely decorated with a few trays of cupcakes that look PERFECT, almost like a Wayne Thibaud painting. The frosting isn't spread on the top of a cupcake: it's more like a perfect little pillow of butter cream. There are lots of different flavors (10+) and the descriptions are on the wall. They have some good cupcakes with filling - the lemon meringue flavor is one of my favorites - and others that are cake with frosting on top (like my other favorite, the sweet chocolate). If you buy multiple cupcakes they put them in a bakery box with little cupcake holders in them so that they don't squish together. Kara's is a fun treat and this location has lots of tables outside that you can sit at while you enjoy your cupcake.
aBTWAcopxc1JrjDqIbQ3ig : Typical over priced organic specialty foods grocery, but they have some amazing prepared food. Love the pizzas and the sandwiches. I enjoy the smoked meats/cheese department. Produce can be on the really expensive side.
QiXw0EK7SqDHwde6SS5BPQ : I had a great experience at this place!  It wasn't too busy today, so I just walked in, and got helped right away. I got Jeannie, who was absolutely wonderful. This is actually only the second time I've ever gone to a hair salon. I used to just get trims at home. The first time I went to a hair salon, the guy didn't listen to what I wanted at all, and I ended up walking out very dissatisfied and wearing a hat for 3 months.   Jeannie worked hard to get it the way I wanted. I wanted to try out a pixie cut, and she actually showed me how short it would be and gave me some time to think it over just to be sure I really wanted it that short. I brought in a picture, and she was super appreciative of that. She has somewhat of a bubbly personality and is really easy to talk to. Plus, she explains each major cut before she does it, and asks if that what you want. She also warned before hand that especially with these more drastic/more styled cuts, she likes to take plenty of time, which is great. She also takes the time to explain the styles of cuts and so on and so forth so you understand why she's cutting it a certain way. She'll give her own recommendations, but ask you for the final decision.  She also took the time to teach me how to use the wax for my hair. She taught me how to do some different styles with the cut, and some other stuff.   There's no shampooing, they just use a spray bottle, and they blow dry your hair at the end and use their hands. Which is fine really... The haircut cost $20.  Overall, I'm okay with the haircut. I was just experimenting anyway. I thought she did a good job though. I'm definitely having her cut my hair for the rest of my time here at school.
o2ZTJN0HZ5OFTdrwflV9tg : I agree with Megan below, Hartley is really disorganized. You need help finding anything in the store because really there is no rhyme or reason as to how they are stacking the shelves there.  The store is also a bit expensive but I suppose that comes from being in New York.  One plus is that they sell stamps though and so I had to bump them up a star for that reason alone.
djU68Ewwb0XWWlUyNxSZRA : If you haven't had yogurt here you are severely missing out.  Once upon a time I came here after trying the chains of new posh yogurt and fell in love.    FRESH fruit.  Great flavors.  Amazing toppings.  It's disappointing that there aren't more of them beyond Claremont.    If you are ever in the area making a Donut Man run, you won't regret the extra stop to chase the sweetness.
0PjIqwGqsG5i7K_X2mZPag : Cabbie's Cab was the most professional cab service I have ever experienced....I can't believe I forgot to yelp the 1st time!  I just called again to book him for another trip to the airport which at $35 you can't beat!   I was impressed that immediately after I booked, I received a confirmation text on my phone. My driver, Rajan was punctual, arriving 10 minutes early. The car was super clean and comfortable and although it was like 5 am- I didn't mind having a conversation with him. He is just a genuinely nice guy...and hi tech I might add. When it came time to pay, he whipped out his IPad and charged my card and sent a confirmation email right then and there. He wished me safe travels and rode away into the sunrise to serve what I am sure will be another satisfied customer.
ryCOvuEBv89NxHk5YsMDjg : The Top Dog grill master achieves super zen state. It's game day and 25 people crowd the holy sausage shrine. Only through perfect concentration, memory and superior customer service will he grant the holy state of sausage fulfillment.   Asking for abuse, the orders rain down like assassin bullets. Two bocks, one lemon chick and an RC cola from the stoned student. Three franks, chicken app and delicious potato salad for the alumnus. Will the onslaught ever stop??? Never!!! And that's how Top Dog gets its sh** done.  There are few things in life more satisfying than a perfectly grilled chicken apple sausage with mustard, ketchup and heaps of onions, potato salad and an RC cola. Who the f*** sells RC cola any more? Thank god for Top Dog. The sausages are uber high quality, similar to Wisconsin's myriad of beer brats. For such little cost Top Dog delivers mega meat enjoyment.
As3LVbZ7RP_yBi1lI_lXUA : Black Walnut serves food that's well, OK. For the student population it seems to draw, it's probably a better choice than your fast food or anything else, so on that note, I can understand it's popularity especially given it's location smack in Rice Village.   I had the salmon dish here for dinner and it was good. I have no complains, but no raves really either. The menu has a pretty wide variety of foods - pastas, sandwiches, burgers, grill items, pizza, etc. - so everyone can probably find something they like. The dessert selection is also huge. Even though I'm not really a fan of order of at the counter restaurants, I liked the spaci-ness of the interior that the whole setup allowed. I would be giving Black Walnut Cafe 3 stars like the majority of people on here, except for one thing. This was incredibly annoying/frustrating/irritating on my part, just because I have issues with carbs (as in, for the most part, I don't like to eat them). I requested to substitue just a side of mixed vegetables for the rice pilaf that came with my dish and was immediately told this wasn't possible. Ok, I know I'm a little high maintenance in general, but isn't this the era of personalization and special orders? It's also honestly not that much of a change on their part, because the dish is hot so they had to grill it after I placed the order. I have never had such a blunt non-accomodation. No, to a simple request for veggies instead of rice pilaf? Let me also say that the dish barely came with any vegetables to start with! I told the girl working there that I wasn't going to eat the pilaf, and she responded that, for the same price, they would just serve me the salmon filet with no sides. Uh, thanks, but no thanks...I'll just give the side to my carb-loving bf.   Anyways, that's Black Walnut. It's a kind of take it or leave it, but you can probably get an alright meal for a decent price.
uO5jODsdSL2gnX_bgDwQ-g : the line was out the door when i arrived here saturday 6ish. the place is small and packed with people. no seating available.  the decor here is greenish and the walls have a sign about the benefits of yogurtland's froyo. they are located just outside the berkeley campus.  i was "in and out" in about 10 minutes in this wall to wall peopled  yogury.  yogurtland is truly the "in and out" yogurt specialist, cheap, clean, fresh, and fast.   flavors available:(all nonfat) -tart -dutch chocolate (made with ghirardelli chocolate)tasted like real chocolate. very cold texture, almost icy. -cherry vanilla -blueberry tart -n.y. cheesecake -fresh strawberry(made with fresh strawberry)real strawberry taste. -double cookies & creme -strawberry & bananae -tiramisu: tasted like tiramisu cakes i had before. -arctic vanilla  pricing: 30 cents per ounce, froyo and "unlimited toppings"., 24 toppings of nuts, cereals, and candies.(labels on the top shelf above the toppings) and 10 fresh chopped  fruit toppings.(unlabled)  i am really impressed. they claim to offer the "most flavorful, natural, and fun frozen yogurt". i assume this means no artificial flavorings, colorings et al. the machines here run slow. the froyo texture is almost firm, more creamy like and not icy.  yogurtland is now my fav operation. the chinese have a saying (yo peing, yo liang-cantonese=it's cheap, it's "wonderful/beautiful/affordable"
3fgr4SE_rRfVfdxL0KAwOQ : When I'm feeling all gung-ho about eating healthy (eh, who am I kidding -- healthier), I'll order one of their ginormous chef salads without getting any shit from my server for ordering the meat as "half bacon and half tofu."    When I really want to grub, I'll order a BLTA and stare at the big brown bowl of densely crunchy yet never greasy big ol' strips of bacon while standing in line.  Since I'm a food weirdo the last bite on that bad mofo always has to consist of pure bacon and avocado bliss.  Seriously, you can't find a better place to gorge your fill (for cheap!) yet still have mounds of food waiting for you in your fridge the next day.  For a poor college kid, that kind of awesomeness is truly heart-warming.  Like, it's almost Hallmark-ian and shit.  Yeah.  Note: It's cash only and you might as well ask for a take-out container while you're paying for your food...especially if you're lazy like me who thinks that trotting back up to the line after I've already eaten a portion the size of my ass is way superfluous and totally annoying.
TT-gOM6Py9UN2fhNxKALWA : GF and me were trying to have reasonable expectations because we've gotten excited about a place from reviews before and been let down in real life...  Pleased and somewhat surprised to say that this place lives up to the hype.  Everything was perfectly done from the drinks (I loved that we could order '2 somethings with gin') to the fried oyster appetizer (fried so fast that they were soft as butter).  Entrees and sides were amazing as well.  Gotten a few different entrees here across our visits and everything was a delicious. Can't wait to go back and work through the whole menu.
gX5mA4ptPagnA1Iu_YZ-ag : It took a while to open, but we were very excited when it finally did. Have been several times since and it has been great each time.  The falafel wraps are delicious but my other half loves the grape leaves. Based on previous falafel experiences, I usually find that I can't even get through half of the wrap - but the portions here are just the right size and the combination of fillings, good.. Today we tried some of their sweets. I think I just picked one that I thought sounded good but didn't taste the way I expected (the semolina square soaked in low fat yoghurt). Needless to say it wasn't like the baklava, which the boy lauded.  The owner is very friendly and you can tell he really has enthusiasm for his business. Would love to see this place succeed!!
S5dBP5ZUb2aLITTljkWXkg : Teriyaki bowls and plates done well - I came here last week and got a chicken & veggie bowl. Very pleased with the chicken and veggies, and i love the sauce. Lots of rice as a base rounds out the meal. My sister and her boyfriend have been coming here a while, and they like the beef even more than the chicken. Overall, good stuff - reminds of the healthy bowls from Samurai Sam's (back when that was around in costa verde).  Good food and relatively cheap and quick makes it a winner!
7M3nO-A69xnGiF7SW2dHTg : I tend to like making my own sushi at home cause I'm picky like that but when I go out for sushi, this is the place I go.  They always have a lunch special (generally under $10) and the quality is consistently good.  The people are also super friendly.  Their bentos are big and just plain fun to get.  At dinner, I usually get the Hai dub bab - it's a salad with a bunch of raw fish and a red spicy sauce.  This is the dish I tend to get where ever I go and Totoro seems to do it the best.  They've got some good roll combos as well.
LkrJSU4a0mAOGOCCjKuzcw : If you are a junkie for junk food which is composed of sugar, Powell's Sweet Shoppe is the place to go to get your high (legally speaking). I was amazed what I could find here...they have whole sections dedicated to Pez dispensers as well as M&Ms! They even carry candy and soda long before my time (for instance, they have "Mary Jane" here, the candy, not the stuff people roll up and smoke that in CA you can get with a "prescription"). Add to that the blaring film of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (the classic one), and it takes you back to a time when you were a kid. There's also a gelato section as well. Nothing like competition for frozen goods in SLO, given that it's right next to Giuseppe's (which sells gelato) and a do-it-yourself yogurt place. It's also nothing like those candy stores in the mall. In fact, it's a level up from that.  Thus, if you're looking for hard-to-find candies (or candies from a different time) and need to satisfy your sweet tooth, Powell's is the place to go.
k8J4PpgKogwELhy75kiN-w : When it comes to Price Center food, there is just such a dearth of choices. And don't even think about venturing outside of the PC food court. Hi Thai and Shogun are absolutely horrendous. Round Table is, I suppose, somewhat decent.   In PC West (the old price center), this Panda Express is usually the place I settle for when I'm just not feeling Santorini or Subway. I mean, I usually get the same thing and at least I know that the food will always be consistent. I've never had a terrible orange chicken. The Panda express chow mein is standard: a greasy mess of noodles and vegetables. And the walnut shrimp isn't half bad (too bad it costs $1 dollar extra).   So +3 stars. 1 because the line does move fairly fast. +1 because you can always score a free entree by filling out a 2 minute survey online using your receipt (how college kids salvage to save money on food), and +1 because panda is on the upper end of the UCSD asian restaurants. But that is a sad sad upper end indeed.   Also, the workers never ever smile at you.
NYH28QEokLEZOLCpBWU6kA : Best bubble tea in Ithaca.  Recommendation: Tyro and Strawberry (Tea/Milk) with tapioca.   The owner (Juan or John) can be a dick. I know his place is pretty popular, but a smile can not hurt your business.
encIwHkymWwVYdjzTqWz3A : Boston is a booklover's paradise and this is a bookstore for the geographer, the wanderer, or the traveler looking to read up on their next adventure.  Good place to spend several hours of time.
wLLQ-1AlWh-FybUH1r4gVQ : I love this place! Usually there is a long wait, but I have gotten lucky several times and gotten a table within 10 minutes of arriving. I've only been for breakfast...my go-to is the Eggs Benedict...classic and amazing!    The menu is so crazy that it usually takes at least 20 minutes to read through it and decide what to get. I've only tried a few things there - one of them was the "crazy quesadilla" which has brie, apple, and mashed sweet potato - in the quesadilla!   The place is decorated really cool - the walls are painted bright green and there are antique-looking mannequins on the walls and old artifacts everywhere. Very cool atmosphere.
RESLmZrWt7kKIHczyWlGqA : I loveddd this place during my college years, but I revisited after a year of deprivation and it failed to hit the spot....  Chrysanthemum milk tea is my favorite.  The regular milk tea, cocoro (coconut & taro!), and kogepan are also hits amongst friends :) But beware, there's a long wait time.....and the waiting area is small with uncomfortable seats -__-  Normally the drinks are very freshly made with chewy boba, but today the boba was mushy/tasteless and the drinks were really bland.....not to mention warm, which made the ice quickly melt and make my drink even more tasteless.....(I know "less ice does not mean more tea" but I was hoping that the tea would be made consistently!)  I'm definitely trying again because I'm hoping today was a fluke.
2zzHX99ltP3-VczC9mjcRQ : FREE FREE FREE!!! well make a donation! dont be cheap! that way you help the museum STAY free... I come here at least 4 or 5 times a year! I enjoy it everytime, even when I have to be chasing after my cousins who do not stay still for a minute. I love that they have different special exhibits which change within some months. They always have baby chicks running around in a glass box and there are always some science center workers teaching children how to make a simple experiment with house hold items. It is a great place to bring the children and enjoy an afternoon of science. And if you want to spend a little cash... the gift shop is great! They have the best items I've ever seen in any gift shop. 5 stars!  PS. I cant wait for the Body World exhibit to come back!!! Saddly very saddly... i missed it the last time it was here.  :(
UbGLt9N9TQpC9848rJgXRw : A little expensive considering the relatively small portions, but the food is to die for. It's just down the street from campus, in a good location. I love the fried rice and pad thai, and the boba is pretty good. The only negative thing is the price: I can get the same portion sizes for $5-6 elsewhere. I'm willing to pay the $9 for one entree every once in a while, cuz the food is amazing, but I probably wouldn't come here more than once a week.
QppBrmHsvE6twpwoqOnF5g : One of the few comic book shops I've been to that didn't make my skin crawl. The people that work there are friendly and genuinely nice. One of the owners is even a girl (who has great taste in comics.) There's good lighting, a great selection and it's right on Franklin St.! If you love comics, but hate going into stores that feel like caves, this is the place for you.
i-RvClzJyuA3s2tNR1b4YA : I'm not a vegetarian and I've tried some of their more adventurous dishes and I couldn't eat 'em. That said, their straight up simple pizzas  (like tomato, basil, and sauce) are pretty awesome. The dough is delicious and the ingredients are fresh...also the price is right. Avoid anything with peanuts, tofu, spinich, or other crazy pizza ingredients!
fvg3cmAOXcpQSvwtAfK7Yg : I am really appalled that this place has 3 and a half stars.  Three years ago I was introduced to the heavenly goodness that is Thai food.    And then I met Thai Basil.  Since then I have tried countless Thai places (I'm not kidding, like 50) and no place compares to this one.  The food is amazing and the price is ridiculously cheap.  Also, I've read some reviews that say that the pad thai is "so-so."  HA!  Who do you think you are?  Better yet, where have you been eating?  The Pad Thai, Basil Fried Rice Chicken and BBQ Pork (moo yang) are the best!!!
3aR7SJht81RN_1a7xHJ4yg : Wonderfully divine Indian food that is just down the street from Brown's campus.  My sister took us to this campus favorite, and after our evening I could tell why this place hits the spot for students here.  We ordered the samosas, vegetable mango curry, and a chicken kabob entree.  The chicken kabob was incredibly tender and juicy, and the vegetable mango curry was surprisingly delicious as it was not over overpoweringly sweet.  I would give it 5 stars except the waiter kept moving us along during our dinner that we felt like we had to rush to eat.  Other than than, it was a great experience and I would definitely recommend this place.
dH9luk1r_PaJ9XOTqYcShg : After hearing all of the raves about this place, I decided that I'll give it a shot and ordered the food to-go. The place is indeed crowded with little place to sit, but I didn't have to bother with it as I ordered 30mins before hand. From hearing everyone saying that a typical 5-star spiciness at other restaurants would be considered a 2-star here, I went ahead and ordered only 2-star.   I wonder if it's just me used to eating spicy food or not, but I tasted no spiciness in the food that I ordered. Very disappointed.  The dishes I ordered were:  Phad Thai -- this was too burnt and oily at the same time. For better phad thai, I would go to Vieng Thong on Rainier or elsewhere, because this is NOT good phad thai.  Curry Chicken Fried Rice -- The flavors were GREAT. I loved this dish, but it lacked spice at 2-star and it was also burnt.  At their price and food, it's a surprise there are so many people waiting in line for a seat.
-N9GrxdMPbG3O68JDGpV4w : i went to harvard square today with my gf for lunch in celebration of our anniversary. i must say that it was the most horrible customer service i have experienced my whole life. we are usually amazing tippers for my gf is a server herself, but we had to bite the bullet and leave what was earned. our drinks were brought out about 15 minutes after we were seated. then when we had finished eating, we waited another half hour for our check (i had to get up and ask for it). i had to ask for a total of 1 (one) refill the whole time. it was awkwardly horrible for somewhere seemingly upscale. after the whole experience, i called to let them know about my experience and i was hung up on (yes, they answered and hung up the phone). my girlfriend then called for a manager and her name was Theresa and spoke to her. overall, the experience was horrible and unpleasant. it seems as though that the place is ran by incompetent servers and management. never again....
bRPaeeJiA5VUIZojj0MbFg : All I can say is if a non-vegetarian pizza addict comes here and says it is the best pizza they have ever had I tend to think that says something....oh no its not me...Im vegetarian so I thought I was just bias. Very crunchy hippie atmosphere, smells kind of funny but the food is WELL worth it.  I would eat their pizza off the dirty alley sidewalk I dont have shame.  The pizza is the perfect size to stuff one person to the gills, better yet is oven baked in front of your face!  Mmmmmm I need to go there right now.
r4oZPf0zSaLfojohUA-SVQ : When I moved from the Midwest to work in the Princeton area I was disappointed with the cafe offerings.  That was before Small World opened.  The coffee is excellent and the atmosphere reminds me of my graduate school days at the University of Michigan.
a0gtHlI8jICQoDmo_M8PUA : i liked this place! i would highly recommend it.  the staff here was great, there is a minimum charge of $5 for credit cards so come prepared if you just want to get a drink.  the drinks were really really good. some of the best boba ive had. they also have tea and coffee so there is something for everyone! the food people were eating looked really good. we didnt have time to sit down and eat.
zf3pfr7H_mL3LTngnW61Yg : Friendly, convenient, good quality.  Unfortunately it gets awfully crowded and then you notice that it is slower than Starbucks.  Better then average, but still a corporate coffee shop
IsE_0b8-_-O7uJuF0RUkIw : Out of all the places in Ackerman I could eat on Tuesdays, I pick Rubio's. Why? Even though the lines can get pretty long, service is quick. Even on a really bad day when the crowd of people waiting for their food almost blocked the path to the tables, I didn't have to wait much longer than 7 minutes.   Admittedly, their "Grilled Steak" and "Grilled Chicken" tacos and burritos didn't taste all that great to me. (I guess it's the high standards I have coming from Long Beach, where there is authentic Mexican food everywhere).   The item I'd most recommend on the menu is the Grilled Mesquite Shrimp Burrito. Admittedly, it's not cheap. It's around $6-7, but they don't skimp on the shrimp. I guarantee you that every bite you take out of the burrito will have a large piece of shrimp in it. The mix of flavors in the Grilled Mahi Mahi Burrito is pretty good too. My only qualm is that I wish they'd put a little less chipotle sauce since I don't like things with creamy texture in my burrito.
BT9J62gb-GjTOsLdOLmBbw : Can't help but say that I for one will NOT miss this place.  IT was a haven for trouble and compared to all the other pubs nearby, there was always trouble here.  To me it was all entertaining, but i can see why this place shut for good.  That being said, Berkeley- UC Campus, has a shortage of places to dance, and venues for small band concerts.  That is where I will miss this place, but not enough to want it back.   The same week that this place closed there was this girl fight outside, and i saw the bartender jump into it like superman and he got his head hit a few times with a cell phone.  I remember thinking that the guy was always kind of a jerk.  Goodbye to Blakes, but honestly.. GOOD RIDDANCE
kUAyiXVUzlcuT3o0XOqq2Q : what a great discovery!  i have no idea why i hadn't been here before.  the atmosphere is great and the CD store is impressive!  i haven't tried the food but was sorely tempted by the items on the menu and the way they looked on other people's plates. yes, i stared... so chances are that i will return and very soon.   the only thing they lack are outlets with grounding - it's dangerous to lack grounding in a wooden environment (chairs, walls, etc.) and what's worse, i couldn't plug my computer for its much required feeding. i told them about that - i'll report if there are any news in that department.
yT7BEdXl9_eoSEMNBwaZTg : It's an ok joint I guess.  I came here to see Annie DiFranco with a friend who had just broken up with his b/f and he had an extra ticket and didn't want to go alone.  I guess it was a mercy mission because I voted for George Bush 3 times (John McCain is too liberal for my tastes- freaky granola eating, cactus hugging Arizona hippie) so I didn't really fit in with the Annie DiFranco fans.  Also, my other friend came here to see the Moz with a girl he had previously sort of dated and her new boyfriend.  That's pretty much the most Morrisey thing you could do.
orjzxGrLSlqiakrDSzuYvQ : This place is a hole-in-the-wall but good food.  Parking: find something on street or park in the Braxton garage (free for an hour during the day).    It is a shack. Literally.  It's outdoor seating. no indoors at all.  Only a few small tables so plan to order to go.  Lately I always order the kimchi fried rice.  It tastes pretty good. The only problem with it is that the rice is too soggy.  It tastes better tomorrow after you microwave it cause it's dryer. :)  They do fill up the lunch box so good portions for the $.  It's a cash-only place but it has an ATM next to the ordering window.
QvE1FMmup3r5ucd6Zxqh1g : Urban Grind has that local charm that we all love so much, with friendly barristas, local artwork on display, organic and fair-trade coffees, and a unique "homemade" eclecticness. The place gives off a happy vibe, and with the free WIFI, I can see this is the type of place you could spend many hours sipping a hot latte while getting some work done.  I did find the furniture to be a little too grungy. I know it fits the style of the cafe, and it is "cool" to have furniture that looks a bit shabby (I guess it adds to the uniqueness?), but I did notice duct tape here and there on the ripped sofas. That's a little too "unique" for my liking.  I ordered a small cappuccino, which was much too weak. It was more like filter coffee with some foamed milk rather than espresso how it should be.  I also noticed that the ice cream in the display freezer seemed to be partially melted. Not sure if that is okay health code wise, seems like it may be a warning sign.  All in all this place is not bad. Don't really see this making it on my regular list, but I can imagine this place would be a big hit for some.
vj9ZuV8g4_3HOI17h411NA : hoooo boy.  i want to boycott this place for as long as that food network moron Guy Fieri (or whatever his name is - seriously, people LIKE him?  are you kidding me?) is the spokesman.  today, though, i didn't have a choice.  it was the lunch choice of the office birthday girl, so i figured hey, the jack daniels menu isn't bad, i can deal!    we got there early and had the place to ourselves.  manchester united was on TV so it was instantly a little bit better in there.  our waitress didn't check on us very often and seemed confused and a bit impatient with our orders.  we watched people come in, order, and dine before our order had been taken.  once it was taken, it took forever for the food to arrive.  there were only 7 of us, we weren't a huge party and the place was not remotely full.  points off for the service.    my honey pecan salmon was delicious, though.  absolutely tasty and better than i expected.  points added for the meal.    the check arrived and the waitress didn't even ask if we wanted dessert or anything else.  i can't recall her checking on us as we ate, either.  what if we needed a side of ranch or a drink refill?  at one point we flagged down a busboy to help us.  when we said we wanted to order dessert, she said ok, left the check on the table, and then disappeared before coming back to take our orders again.  very confusing.  we were confused, she seemed confused that we were confused.  argh.  in the end, we were all mostly satisfied with our meals but not so much so with the service.  it's pretty much par for the course for this chain.
1piRUGc-6JD1_wbxIAz3Vw : World's finest dun dun noodles right here.  Seriously, I've been around the world and have had dun dun noodles in many cities on several continents, and these are my favorite.  With chicken or without, they're cheap, hearty, and spicy as hell.  The dumplings aren't bad, either.  Downside: tea is awful, and many dishes aren't bad, but are pretty ordinary.  No credit cards, so hit the ATM before you come here.
7V6DqcAa25lXo-u0gwOfKg : Came for dinner with my dad. Of course he wants to drink so we started with a bottle of cold sake.  Grilled shishto pepers? Yummy and moist bit spicy jap egg plant.. i always love egg plants.. don't matter how they're cooked large sashimi dinner - about 16 pieces of sashimi Had to order a separate order of Uni! I love UNI! it was delicious and fresh, probably the best I had for awhile. then boiled spinach (very plain, i just wanted more veges) Brown rice  Large bottle of beer hahah gotta love japanese beer.  Sat here and talked to the father for 2 hrs.. good vibe, small restaurant, close to his studio in pasadena, Def coming back here again.  Bill was total 85 plus tip we paid 100.
rpqBb2DLGe4wYhSxx45cgg : Regarding the holy trifecta of foods for a 21-year old male college student like myself with no regard for his health- the pizza, the hot dog, and the hamburger- I've always considered the pizza and the burger to be in a deadlock for first place with the hot dog lagging far behind. It isn't as flavorful or satisfying as the other two. Of course, that all changed when I tried Top Dog. Particularly the Calabrese, with ketchup, spicy mustard, onions and tons of sauerkraut!  What is there to say about this place that hasn't already been said? It kicks ass... everything about it. Just because it's three in the morning doesn't mean you have to settle for shitty or overpriced food! You can still come here and buy two dogs, one for you and one for that girl you met at the frat (and hopefully it's not the last wiener she's going to see that night!).
W1AJEvKrDSGprELCZzCUag : I thought I'd given up writing reviews, but I feel compelled to say something about my recent experience here.  Really, there was nothing wrong with the food, but, gads! couldn't someone mop the floors, clean the men's restroom, or wipe the tables? The restaurant has a section where everything is enclosed by middle-eastern carpets--DUSTY carpets. You can see the motes rising up whenever someone sits in there.  I showed up at lunch hour on a Sunday, and the place was busy, with people ordering at the street-side window and at the inside counter. After 15 minutes of watching everyone else get their orders, I went up to the counter and asked about my order. Another five minutes later an order did come to my table, with a complimentary baklava, but it was the WRONG order.  I'm not sure that I want to trade cleanliness and competent service for cheap food when so many other places can deliver all three in Spades.  Just something to think about. . . .
YEBxHyGDiO1LGpn29HhiLg : My boyfriend and I deemed this our "best Groupon experience ever." Service was impeccable, food was to die for, and even the Malbec was on point.   Service: The waiter was upbeat, friendly, and attentive. He all but read our minds when we were making our selections. What we found most impressive was that the wait staff managed to serve multiple tables at once (also a testament to kitchen staff timing). Our food came out quickly, but not too quickly as to feel rushed.  Food: We started with the octopus appetizer, which was perfectly cooked, seasoned, and portioned (i.e. there was a lot, even for two). We also ordered the steaks medium-rare, which were complemented well by the green pesto sauce and fingerling tomatoes. We even noticed the quality of the olive oil with which the bread was served--it was that good. And lastly, we ordered the creme brulee, which we don't usually do. Our reasoning: When you're at a high-gastronomie restaurant like Vareli, the seemingly simple dishes are sometimes the most enjoyable. They didn't disappoint, either; the creme brulee was the best I'd had in a while.  At the end of our meal, we even had a chance to chat with and thank the manager. He was gracious and even took the time to refill our waters when he realized they were low. He spoke about how Groupon had drawn people from around the world to his restaurant, of which he was still in awe. We told him that we didn't live too far, and that we'd be back...
sOkQzXuprtvWdwSnV9VqYA : I have been going to Class Tailors for 4 years and have had my last straw.  I am never going back.  The quality started to decline a year ago when the owner went on maternity leave.  Now the shop is run by the owner's mom, an older Vietnamese lady who is a little difficult to communicate with (but I was willing to look past this for a quality job).  Last year, I had my Burberry jacket sleeves taken in.  When I received the jacket back, the sleeves were uneven and asymmetrical.  One side was clearly shorter than the other.  When I went back to the store, the lady told me that this is natural because one arm is usually longer than the other.  However, when I put on the jacket and showed her that one sleeve is obviously longer than the other, she told me that there was nothing she could do about it.  Great, a waste of $300 for the jacket and $30 for hemming the sleeves.  I had great experiences with Class Tailors in the past, so I was willing to put that bad experience behind me.  This is until this past month, I brought in 3 pants to hem.  These were nice tropical wool dress pants with a liner inside.  After charging me $50, I went home to find the pant legs to be uneven in length.  When I wore them with my flats, the left side was 0.5-1cm longer than the right!  Yes, the difference is slight, but enough to be noticeable, especially at a nice work event!  I am now completely fed up with the poor quality of this establishment.  It is sad that Class Tailors used to provide such good service and impeccable quality.  I have fond memories of Class Tailors, but the store has cost me too much in frustration and money wasted on new clothes ruined by poor tailoring.  Go spend your time and money elsewhere.
-1VIWkDu3EvpIC_asYeQ6g : We came here for a engagement celebration with a few friends, made reservation for a table at 8:15 for Sat night. The sushi rolls we had were good, the appetizers we ordered were the calamari (much different considering they added glass noodles) which was really good in flavoring. Then we had dessert which was also really good with the lava cake, and different tasting of creme brulee flavors. The place was quite dark using candles to see the menu, but the design of the decor is of Japanese fusion style with the kimonos. This place gives the ambiance of a lounge as well. There is outdoor seating area to lounge with drinks. The kitchen for the sushi bar & kitchen was open giving the restaurant a more spacious feel.
EPZpitVK73GZWdhFAqoWZw : This is the first restaurant where I've actually wanted to thank the chef for the wonderful meal.  Instead, there was a comment card with the bill, so that was filled out.  It was delicious!  I am a vegetarian, so it is harder for me to find good vegetarian dishes in non-vegetarian restaurants.  I ordered the Vegetable Bento Box that consisted of grilled vegetables, fried tofu, asparagus risotto cake, peanut-noodle salad (yum!), and sun-dried tomato roll.  I experienced all the different flavors and so many different textures in one meal.  My other friends all ordered sushi rolls and they enjoyed it.    One less star for the long wait for our party of 7.  We had to wait 45 mins - 1 hr for our food.   It was also a little too dark (I guess it sets the mood), this experience taught me how important it is to be able to see your food.
T9EH8n-s5aYFtGAOHQLHFQ : first time here today in this small little shop. i went during early afternoon on a weekday. no one was in line, though a couple people were sitting inside enjoying their desserts. i ordered the double chocolate chip cookie with mint chocolate chip ice cream. it was a tasty $2 ice cream sandwhich. the cookies were served a bit warm so my ice cream melted kinda quick. my cookies were pretty thin and they had cracks here and there so the ice cream eventually leaked through that too. its actually a pretty messy snack. next time, i want my cookies served cold. maybe it'll be less messy? otherwise, it was a nice treat and will definitely recommend this shop to whomevers craving for ice cream..and if im in the area of course (parking and foot traffics heavy in this part of town)!
K4O99F_PHxWDSqHzjDwgoA : DON"T USE THIS COMPANY!!! They don't even deserve a star, but Yelp requires at least one!!!  The standard rate for going from Chapel Hill to RDU is $38.  I was asked en route if I would be willing to split the cab ride, to which I obviously said yes because splitting the cab ride also means splitting the fare.  After I arrived the cab driver took $40 from the other passenger and told me I owed him an ADDITIONAL $38 dollars.  When I told him that we had agreed to split the ride and fare he pretended like he had no idea what I was talking about.  What's worse is that the Manager refused to make good on the agreement either.  I warned him that I would write a scathing review online, but that didn't seem to bother him.  Eventually, the driver called over a police officer and I was given the option of fighting it in court or paying $38.  So here's to the driver, the manager, and the duplicitous way in which this company does business...DO NOT USE THEM!!
XRtc3cDSJc6rGgE_RH7rvA : Oh yum.  Yep that's exactly how I would describe the sang Kee duck and stuffed eggplant. They originally gave us wraps for the duck but were more than happy to exchange them for steamed buns after I asked. The duck was superb and eggplant very flavorful without being overly salty.  Service is fantastic and our waiter even told me to like the restaurant on facebook to get an additional coupon. Plus, they gave s the student I'd discount today too. Validated parking at the Sheraton is only $5.  I'll be back.
Puoe_S-DaUcP-q-UMAI_GQ : Rick's!  As I said in the Rick's entry for East Lansing, the one in Ann Arbor (unlike the EL version) is so god-awful that it actually circles around and is good again.  As long as you don't take yourself to seriously and can laugh at the pitiable surroundings, Rick's is a good place to be.  That said, at least for me it's a once in a while place.  The sharkbowls are tasty but too sweet to drink more than one of.  They're fun to share but easy to spill.  That sort of describes the girls there as well after a few drinks, and I'm pretty sure a lot of people are there for this.  I can also second that grad students actually go here, as many of the law school bar nights are held here.
jrPUJ_Bt6MMkCz1HEkSUEA : I'm a grad student at Pitt, and I go here all the time. The Granola Works with Yogurt is generously portioned, filling, healthful, and dirt cheap- probably the best lunch under $5 in all of Oakland. For beverages (which I only rarely get), it's not spectacular, but it's worlds better than Pitt's cafe, Cathedral Coffee. The free wifi is also a nice bonus.  For 1-3 people grabbing beverages or something light, it's great, but I would not recommend this place for large groups for a meal. But it's a coffee shop, so you should probably know that already.
SQXk5-hxz78pYT0TJmmorA : What a great little store! The staff was very friendly and helpful. I'm looking forward to buying my pet supplies (they  carry all of the major brands) from there, as opposed to having to schlep them from mid-town. My pooch walked out of there (I bought him a new leash and collar, they threw in a t-shirt for free) looking like a million bucks.
c_pJiMkyRpl6Jo3xV-Fk5A : What a great addition to the Ave, a much needed break from the Asian cuisine and bar food selection peppering the neighborhood.  Wing Central has only been opened for a few months and the owner, Jim, is certainly making a name for the joint and himself with the UW crowd.  The place is clearly Husky-oriented. Following the success of its Ellensburg location, Wings Central is a light version of the original.  Don't be fooled by the title of the restaurant, this place has some of the best burgers in the business.  In fact, one of the burgers, the Scholarship Burger, benefits a scholarship program at the UW to support working students.  What a great way for both the restaurant and the customer to give back!    The decor of the place is suited as a sports bar, with a full wall projector that places the hottest event or news in the center of the restaurant for all to see.  Since this is a restaurant and not a bar, this should be the choice spot for ALL AGES to enjoy watching a sporting event.  I can only imagine what this place would look like if the UW makes it to the NCAA Basketball Tournament.  I've had the opportunity to eat here on a handful of occasions.  The service staff is wonderful -- very friendly and helpful.  They try their best to anticipate your needs -- we've never had an empty cup of water or soda in front of us.  The food has been outstanding, especially the burgers and the wide variety of dipping sauces for fries or wings.
w64Igk_avZ0msP6ZtIvBOg : Their breakfast burritos got me through my first two years living on campus. Tater tots + bacon + salsa + cheese + fake eggs + flour tortilla + a side of onion rings and ranch = nirvana in la la land. A few times a week, I would get one breakfast burrito for breakfast and one for a late night snack; it's THAT good.  OVT, your food sucks more than my elementary school cafeteria but nonetheless, I love you. Your 1,500 calorie breakfast burritos made me the (fat) man I am today.   Also OVT, Your sad, almost pathetic Valentine's Day dinner was so tempting and sexy that after a real Valentine's Day dinner at the Chart House that day, my date and I paid $40 each (in meal points of course) for a prime rib w/ shrimp dinner at OVT. Trust me, I will never forget. And my parents will never forget either, for depositing hundreds of dollars into my meal point account because of your outrageous pricing. But hey, when I need to study but run out of Red Bull to mix my vodka with, you were there for me. OVT, you are my soul mate.    You know what they say....two breakfast burritos a day, keeps the doctor away.
pFEWWi39beSvMD3SZ57DGg : Pretty satisfying. I was starving, felt like having indian food....chutney's did the trick.   Paratha chicken tikka 'burrito' ...it was really tasty and filling for 8 bucks with a drink.   They also have various chais, fresh mango lassi and drinks like thumbs up!  Not the best indian food in the world but a good deal! I'd go back.
o6-aW8jdHvjMwyTmTtN0hA : I went here out of morbid curiosity, because a friend of mine told me that their "Phat Sandwiches" (or whatever they're called) were featured in some magazine and had somehow achieved fame for being sort of over-the-top indulgent.  I and a couple friends had one of these (each one of us had a different variety), and I don't believe any of us were that impressed.  It was good, but if you're going to consume a billion calories, there are much better ways to consume them.  It was kind of like they took existing meals and just stuck them into bread.  E.g. I had some fried chicken strips, cheese, and marinara sauce.  Except stuffed in a giant piece of white bread.  Do you get the idea?  If you have a really limited, fast-food-oriented American palate, you might like this, but otherwise there's nothing special here.
ApENHkkDyX2t9q6jEhg0qA : Had lunch here on a Saturday around 3:00pm.  Dead when we got there but lively when we left.  House-brewed beers were great and cuisine was very creative for bar food.  Lots of game on the menu.  Wanted to try the antelope, but table did not agree.  Good place to go after hitting-up Hop City or an art gallery.
r9BiJYV3lf8KVHsnqu8lvw : We arrived at the W hoping to be able to park in an outside lot to avoid the Valet Parking fee ($32 for overnight guests); unfortunately, there wasn't a parking lot nearby. Second, the University Religious Conference Center was located right behind our bedroom so we could hear the students talking loudly and playing their music. In addition to the noise outside, we could hear guests going on and off the elevator in addition to the toilet flushing from the room above us. On the flip side, the hotel is very posh. I was pleasantly surprised by the size of our accommodation and was pleased with the free car service as well.
fpre7MbC9k5Z_K47BXeIFA : This is the Chipotle where a bunch of UT staff got sick a couple summers ago, but I've eaten here a bunch and didn't have a problem.  UT sent out an email warning everyone not to eat there for a couple days, even, but it didn't have long term effects.  Anyway, I like this Chipotle.  Lots of seating, and it's surprisingly not that hard to find a spot on the drag around like, 5pm, when I used to  meet fellow un-rich grad students before night class.  $5.75 isn't too bad at all.  Back when I lived near campus, it was a great reason to go for a walk to grab dinner and walk back home to eat in front of the TV.   I order the veggie burrito.  It's huge.  Jen C. and I call it "eating a baby" because it's so big, it looks like an infant wrapped in tin foil.  You could cradle your dinner, guys.  The white rice is so delicious, it made me like white rice again- lime juice is their secret, I surmise by taste.
nwYySVb3lGET0dx-P0MoGA : Awesome place to catch an improv show!  It is dirt cheap compared to other comedy clubs around the city (especially if you have a student ID) but their crew is just as good, if not better.    My favorite time to come is Friday night around 10:30 when 2 Girls 3 Eyes performs.  I have seen them multiple times over the past couple of years and they never disappoint.  Relapse used to be BYOB but has been renovated to include a full bar, so sadly there will be no more brown bagging it here for me.
kSFEl3pvqbHtUH6USWyL2w : I have been unemployed for quite some time now, so I've gotten a couple of haircuts here.  You really can't beat $14 for a cut, and I certainly have the time that it takes.    They typically answer the phone promptly, (even if they put you on hold), and are extremely cheerful.    For my first cut: I took the advice of those who had gone before me, and asked for a more experienced student.  My stylist was a chipper 19 year old girl.  I asked for, and received, long layers.  (and tea!)  Her instructor came by periodically to check on us.  She chattered on about her life, boys, and  generally bored me to tears.  My hair, however, looked fabulous.  For my second cut, I went on a day  where salon services were free!  (It turns out they wanted people to make a donation to the Surfrider Foundation.)  My stylist looked like Eva Longoria Parker.  With tattoos.  Amazing.  After she washed my hair and started trimming, she asked me if I had my hair thinned last time I got it cut.  Now, if you know me, you know that my hair is not hair that needs thinning.  I gaze enviously at women with heads of thick hair and dream of not using volumizing shampoos.  Don't get me wrong: I have plenty of hair, but... yeah.  It doesn't need thinning.   She told me that based on the way it's growing in, it was thinned last time.  (Which is weird.  Maybe the previous stylist could see I was bored and sought revenge?  Maybe she had an upcoming test and wanted to practice the technique?  Maybe Eva didn't know what she was talking about?)    In any event, she finishes cutting, blows it dry, and tells me I should have another four inches cut off, due to damage.  While I don't really want to lose the length, I tell her to lop it off.  Which she does.  Which leaves me with no layers to speak of.  While I would like her to layer it up a little, I parked at a meter, so I let it go.    I didn't see the instructor until the very end of my cut, but they were insanely busy.  (Which you'd expect on a free services day.)  A woman walked around offering free manicures, which I would have loved, but again-- metered parking.    If you're looking for a good, inexpensive cut, and you have time, this is a good spot.  If I had requested my stylist to redo my layers, I'm sure she would have, and done it cheerfully.  Just be sure to keep an eye on the time.  Parking tickets in Westwood are as common as backpacks.
TuPyJ9kBsKyXy8R8K1HxGA : Forgot we'd been here last weekend. The jack hammering going on out front drove the experience out of my mind.   I'll be honest, as I become more and more of a tea snob, I drink less and less coffee. I don't want the caffeine, and good decaf is hard to come by. And, at this point, I find coffee to be a bit intense of a flavor set for first thing in the morning. But on weekends, Liz and I usually get a coffee and a nosh while running errands. Last weekend we had business with a rug merchant, and discovering that NOTHING in Rice Village except the coffee shops seems to open until 10am, even on Saturdays (really?) we decided to sit down here and have a bite and a sip before having our minds blown by the price tags on Iraqi tabriz carpets.   The coffee here is REALLY good. REALLY good. I almost had a Twin Peaks moment with it. Although, I think I just dated myself horribly with that line.   I actually don't remember what I had as a pastry. That's actually probably a good thing. It means it wasn't too big or too weird. It wasn't the brioche, Liz thinks it was probably a cheese danish, and that's a safe bet. If I don't remember that means there was no weird weeping going on, and it wasn't coated in an inch thick shell of glazed sugar. Again, the jack hammering really was a problem.   Don't take this review to be any kind of indication about their sandwiches, soups or anything of that sort. I have no idea. I just know they serve good coffee.
-kUZP0BU2hIhdyEm__S06w : Today I bought a mattress from Furniture Follies for our guest bedroom. Since my wife and I would not be sleeping on it nightly (hopefully) we were not too picky and therefore did not do a lot of research. For the most part we picked based on price and brand (yes, marketing at its best). My wife had heard this store had some great discounts because the mattresses aren't sold as "unopened".   Furniture Follies generally carries showroom sample mattresses and mattresses with minor blemishes. They give the mattress a grade (A, A-, B, etc.) and then group them by size (Twin, Full, Queen, King). Most (maybe all) are still wrapped in plastic so it might be a bit harder to really get a feel for the comfort but this did not bother me. The prices of the mattresses range from about $200 (economy) to $1000 (super plush and high quality). We bought a mattress for about $275 less than what it is selling for at Sam's Club (awesome deal!).  On top of the great prices, the owner was very helpful, friendly, knowledgeable and honest (or maybe I'm a hapless fool :). He walked us all around the store and explained why some mattresses are more expensive than others, and he did all of this without being overbearing. He explained which items sell well. He even gave us some tips on how to save money. For example, he proposed that we could buy an economy box springs because they're about the same as the name brand versions. He wasn't trying to get the quick sale. He offered to notify us if new inventory came available that matched our search. Luckily, we did find a mattress that we liked so we didn't have to wait. They will deliver your large item purchases to Chapel Hill/Carrboro for $35 and to Durham for $45.  We were told by the owner that they were being careful about overstocking on the mattresses because there was a chance in the near future that they would need to find a new location due to renovations that were coming to their building complex. These renovations were expected so I don't think this is a sob story about how the leaser is increasing rent. Apparently, Furniture Follies got a really good deal on the space (hopefully means more savings for us customers). If they move they'll keep the same name and phone number.  Oh, and, by the way, they sell new and used furniture (I think it's mostly used furniture though). Mattresses seem to be a big part of their business but there's certainly a lot of other furniture items in their inventory. Check their website for a list of their furniture inventory (very helpful!).
Noo1hKpaUXjwC-U7uzp0ew : The Food in general are nice from Thai Corner, For the starter,I love the chicken satay and fish cake,and the egg roll is not bad neither (its free if you pay over 25).For the main, I especially love the chef special spicy seafood and the tofu with peanut sauce,hmmmm,yummy!! I gave 4 instead of 5 because of their service. I feel almost being bullied everytime when they deliver. They have this aggresive way of asking for tips which i am actually really afraid. :(
uDr6PlVPXiFVw4NW0wDZmw : I've been to the Globe for pretty much every meal possible  - brunch, lunch, dinner - and now for an event (http://www.yelp.com/biz/gKxZvgmhpMC-1EmS648MtA#hrid:KUtftR25Y4-qSrerzJDGFA) and late night drinks, too!   The interior is all clean lines + modern decor. . .   Yes, the Herman Miller chairs make me drool. Yes, I think the Pelligrino wall is fabulous (probably helps that I could drink the stuff by the gallons). Yes, I wish my living room looked like this. And, yes, I even love the font they use on the menu.  Ah, and the food! My most recent meal was a tableful of steak frites from their late night menu - did you know that the closer it gets to midnight, the better a steak tastes? As for the rest of the menu, it's new American all the way - they've got selections like well done classics like fried calamari and a fresh fish selection. Actually. . . last year one of their recipes that I had tried, the spaghettini, was published in the paper. I liked it enough to save it and even email it to a friend (um, but no, it didn't taste quite like it does at the Globe when I tried to make it)!   And as an event space, there are a lot of options - from the lounge area in the front, to the 'library,' a private back room. They're well staffed and suited to cater to special events.   Depending on the night, they have valet, but they always validate parking in the near by parking deck, which is a huge bonus for Midtown.    This is one of the restaurants that I've frequented quite a bit - and I'm excited to see the upcoming new additions they soon plan to add to the menu.   And if you won't let me move in, at least you'll let me dine here.
J8D5TV1GLZR2EJDdi9OBKg : My luck with restaurants has been dwindling lately. Went to Islands for lunch...I mean you can't go wrong with a hamburger right?  First, the restaurant was freezing cold. Like goosebumps and shivering cold. Everyone at the table, all 6 of us were dying.   Service was efficient and friendly. Nothing superstar but good.   Food...eh. Everything was too salty. The price was a little much for the food. Honestly, it was a burger. It wasn't anything fantastic and I'm sure I could have gotten the same thing at Red Robin.
_3vpisof6fWupuC-r7KnOg : Sava's, not to be confused with Seva's is a pretty nice lunch spot.  Although it's been open for a while now, this past week was my first time there!  I had lunch and there was a wide variety to choose from, I ended up with the Lobster BLT which my server told me could be put into a wrap instead of just on bread.  Smart server = great food idea.  The wrap was delicious and had lots of lobster and bacon.  The pesto aioli was equally as good but there might have been too much of it on the wrap for me.  Next time I'll for sure get it on the side.  The polenta fries were great, probably some of the best I've had!  I will surely come back and have those again!  The restaurant itself was very clean and bright, our server was attentive and knowledgeable.  The only draw back of this place is how hot the restaurant is inside.  I'm not sure if Sava's thought they could get away with not having AC inside but usually people ask to be seated inside to avoid the heat, not feel like they are in a sauna.    Overall, decent places, large lunch variety and nice atmosphere, as long as you can take the heat.
KHk_sHbrC_fmWSXpK4tIZw : I have written my fair share of 1 star reviews but this is one doctor that I could NEVER give a bad review. I was on vacation in San Diego and broke my foot. I had no idea where to go or what the deal was with my insurance or anything. Dr.Murken was referred to me by the office for being a foot and ankle specialist . He was probably the nicest doctor I ever had, New York doctors are the worst! He took his time explained everything in detail.  I asked an insane amount of questions and he answered every single one of them and got me in for surgery right away. If i was seen in NY i probably would have been put on a 2 month waiting list and felt like I was just an account number and not an actual person.   I was alone in San Diego and now going into surgery and Dr. Murken couldn't have made me feel more comfortable about the procedure.  My foot feels amazing and I wish we had more doctors like him back home!    Sky*
SQLZz7egpDJl3hxhgzy3Pw : Wham BAM thank you Ma'am.  It was like that.   The BAMscape was pretty sweet http://static1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/QQfIT35FhxuBe3hP4d3anA/l, but we didn't stay for very long because they were blasting new age music like it was a metal concert. I have nothing against new age music, I promise. It was just very hard to concentrate while reading or even relax for that matter. Isn't new age music supposed to be relaxing? Not when it's blasting in your ears! My seat on the orange wave reverberated, our voices muted as we tried to talk. If they don't play any loud music, I'll be back! My friend said that this was the first time they ever played music *shrug*   I liked that we were able to sit, lie down, climb, walk up and down across these cool orange undulations. No shoes allowed and make sure you have socks on! I expected the waves to be more foam-like and bouncy, but it turns out there's wood encasing the foam. Bouncy foam would be so much more fun and comfortable.  However, it's still a fun idea since you can actually touch and hell, lie down on, the art. To the side of the space, they have a little table with coffee and pastries for sale as well. Even better, there are some outlets available so you can work http://static1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/lGyOBs0_ciavY2pHzSsNKA/l  So here's an alternative to the humdrum library or cafe if you want to study or catch up with a friend. The BAMscape is ongoing until November 2011.
sgPK-8Mlzry-_y-ZayxVQg : Why do people go here? really? for the crappy hookah, that's ashier than ashy larry? For the sort of ok really overpriced food? for the "ambiance" of screaming people who have taken a relaxing activity and made it incredibly hectic? or for the pricks in their ferraris outside adding to the "ambiance" (and btw i'm a car guy, i love cars, i know alot about cars, and i know you're a prick if you feel the need to drive up and down broxton in your exotic for some sick form of self validaiton based of the jealousy of people in their early twenties)  Habibi's is never worth it. Never. If you want to Hookah go buy one, they aren't that expensive and you don't have to put up with the Ferrari pricks.
2Uzf5LFftAm8w1_zyQTcQA : I spotted this H&M from a mile away. No joke. I've seen H&M advertised in Seventeen Mags, Teen Vogue, etc, etc... So I thought, why not give it a try for my graduation dress?   So here it goes....1...2... 3...OMG is that what I think it is? Is my phobia of overcrowded stores and long lines coming true? Here, it is!   I expected to be greeted.... and helped....(which I wasn't) if i'm walking through the store with three other make-uped foil heads with wallets so full of cash they stick out from the deepest pockets known to man.   Not taking that too personally, i continue with my hunt. I scan through the racks full of clothes that seemed to be, you know... that same design... in the usual colors... Nothing that shouted European Botique. Nope.  I went to the sales racks and picked up a dress, then tried to find some more "fancier" party dresses. All I could come across was summer-y dresses.   I finally asked someone for help of where possible party  dresses could be. I went and checked it out, only to be disappointed by bland designs and blinding price tags.  In the end, I picked out a cute skirt with a top. I'm glad that I didn't buy it. I would've regretted going to a upscale party with something that I would wear on an everyday basis
GYqxeU9ivnD47QXccggbUw : Wow lots of hatred for the UCLA Library.  Normally I am not that school spirited but I do think this is a nice library.  It's pretty big and quiet most of the time.  You will find lots of people napping and drooling around.  I normally don't go to the library much, but I like hanging out in the computer lab while waiting for a class to start.  I guess I don't study that much since I never come here at night.  I didn't know they card, but I can kind of understand.  They just want to protect their students and be anal.  It IS the UCLA Library... and not public... sorry to those who can't get in... but it's still a nice library during the day.  I love that you can check out laptops in the computer lab and play games.  It's very convenient.  Umm did I mention I don't study much?  As you can see what I do in the library.  O=9 Although I must complain about those stairs.  I am lazy too! ^_^  Aside all that... the people at the information desk are pretty nice.  Everyone is pretty laid back in the day time.  Sorry about the night people... I wouldn't know anything about night time since I rather study at home or lack of studying.
iu0uKRK7aXEWOcWje8wc8g : I'll be honest...No Thai may not be "authentic" but who cares? IT TASTES GOOD!  (and food should taste good) . If you want a quick, satisfying meal that won't break the bank...go to No Thai.   My hands down favorite is the POTATO CURRY. It changed my life. literally. This is the dish that made me apply to No Thai (and eventually work there and gain ~5lbs because I couldn't stop eating it..it's like crack). So although I might be a little biased as a former employee, keep in mind I wrote this (for my blog) after my first No Thai experience BEFORE I started working there.   an ode to potato curry   *ahem* (clears throat)  potato curryy...how do i love thee? let me count the ways i love thee for thy tender inner core and thy crispy outer shell i do so adore i love thee for thy spicy nature so painful to taste, yet rapture to endure i love thee daily, as from the east the sun will rise i love thee surely, as straight as the crow will fly i love thee with a love i give to few with my last penny, --- i freely give to you i shall but love thee to thy last bite.  Tried their Green curry when I was back in Oct...yummy also!  Other faves: After drinking-Sweet & Spicy chicken; Missing home-any of their fried rices!   Note: They actually spice to your taste (I'm a spice fanatic and yoga flame is my perfect heat). Get the potato curry with broccoli added!
5t35WLQYZKkLfLmnGBqyaw : Happy China is by far the cleanest American Chinese restaurant in town. The food is consistently fresh and delicious. Delivery service sometimes takes longer than you would think, but when the food finally arrives, you'll forget the wait while you devour the excellent food. The lunch menu is ridiculously inexpensive for the amount of food.
i7cx2ANu1W0tjxBQTDOWuA : Yes. I did it. I gave a chain, fast food restaurant 4 stars.   I've only had their fish tacos here and I have never been disappointed. I like how the fish is slightly breaded on the outside - it gives it a good texture. The fish is always moist and the servings are fairly large for such a small taco. I typically order the 2 fish taco especial (comes with guac) plate which includes beans and chips. It's a hearty meal and all for $7. Can you really complain?!  Taco Tuesday: $1.50 fish tacos after 2pm. Talk about contributing to the freshman 15 at UCSD! Thanks, Rubio's!
EzTYPB0eEYslGcAkjWDMBA : i love saca's! this is hands down one of the best restaurants i've been to in the area. the food is amazing, they serve hearty portions, most dishes are under $10, and the staff is so friendly! this place is definitely one of the things i miss most about living there. just be sure to bring cash; last time i checked, they were still a cash-only establishment.
W0QKIbOBpPDD56umLllxsg : It was lunch time and we were deeply, truly thirsty. Unbeknownst to us, this place has the largest sodas in the entire world. It was sort of cosmic. But the meal went down hill from there.   Chips and salsa were fine. I had the catfish tacos and I was pretty much horrified by a dish of deep fried fish nuggets embedded in cheese and folded in flour tortillas; I think I read the menu too quickly. But the fish was nice and fresh (and upon biting I found it was whole big pieces) and I removed the cheese and placed it in the do-not-eat pile, with my sad jumbalaya and the rather "special" sauce that came with the tacos.   Next time I'd watch my step, but there's not likely to be a next time.
wYrGlHoEz3FaEYGNEw4U8Q : I hate the parking lot!! I hate that you have to validate parking for going to the grocery store. ugh.  Do you ever notice that you smell when you come out of this store? It's a combination of frozen meat and some other weird shit.  That is a major pet peeve of mine.  Other than that, this store is fine for my goodies run for the office. At least I get to go shopping during work.
408hwioZ-qUozGrKzoqKqQ : I had the most amazing wrap here the other day. It was the steak and egg wrap. Soooo delicious...just thinking about it makes my mouth water. Grilled steak, peppers, and onion mixed with scrambled eggs and melted cheese all bundled together in a soft wrap. Yum! I wish I lived closer so I could get one tomorrow morning!  Oh and the coffee drinks are not bad either. I highly recommend the iced mocha carmel latte.
iDcwgYVOw-XN9ws5l_E4BQ : Really really great Indian food, generous portions. A little pricey, but unless you're starving, one order can usually satisfy my bf and I, or last for two meals. Garlic naan is a crowd pleaser; if you're with some skeptical friend who's uncomfortable eating anything that's not chicken fingers, the naan is sure to win them over.  One thing that I find variable is their spicy level. This place means SPICY when you ask for it. And their "medium spicy" is medium SPICY so be warned! I've seen more than one diner complaining about how their food is too hot. BUT, I do find they use their judgment a little when deciding on spiciness. A friend of mind ordered for delivery and pronounced everything as authentically as she could; her food came out crazy spicy! Next time, she donned a "white girl" voice and acted a little confused on the phone... spiciness significantly reduced.  Other perks? The mango lassi is a treat, and I always look forward to the scandalous Bollywood music videos playing on their two flatscreens. ;)
h2Ce4cBPT-fN16J0TVb6Hw : After vacationing in North Carolina, we stopped in Chapel Hill for lunch at Top of the Hill, which had been recommended to us by friends.  Very attentive service.  Soon after we were seated, our drink order was taken, and delivered to us in under 5 minutes.  Speaking of the drinks, the beers were great!  For lunch, we started with the lizard chips, which were fried jalapeno and pickle slices served with a remoulade.  We were expecting spicy  (which we enjoy), but the jalapeno chips bordered on mouth burning.  On the other hand, the thinly sliced pickle slices were battered nicely were crispy.  For lunch I had the french onion soup....a very nice broth, with a good amount of browned cheese on top.  My lunch companions ordered the french onion soup, the black and bleu burger (a Cajun spiced patty topped with plenty of bleu cheese and red onion) and the cheeseburger.  All seemed very happy with their choices.  Unfortunately, it was torrentially downpouring outside, so we were relegated to sitting inside.  The view would have been really lovely if the weather were more cooperative.
jjN4ko4TZje5LQfDDxNbDg : Heaven is where you get Toscanini's ice cream in New Hampshire side-of-the-road ice cream stand portions. This, however, is Earth, so we'll all just have to settle for tiny scoops of creamy goodness in the meantime.  Burnt caramel ice cream: just do it.  PS, they had it at Star Market once. I bought three pints.
uPX38bZFlRp0yAc6W8MuUA : Unfortunately, my fiance and I didn't come here for their specials, but we were satisfied with the large dinner portion rare among the better restaurants these days.  You buy a dinner and it includes thick slices of  tomato-herbed bread and the accompanying herbed garlic dipping sauce and a side salad with a balsalmic viniagrette for starters.  My rigatone norcina was well-spiced and reasonably salted from the cream sauce and spicy sausage (both very bad for my diet) and my fiance's pollo alla siciliana was very tasteful.  Just thinking about the place is making me drool over my leftovers - can't wait to go to work just to have them for lunch!  And don't forget: Monday night special (dine-in or carry-out) - buy one pasta dish and get the 2nd one of equal or lesser value for $3.99 Tuesday night special (carry-out only) - buy one large pizza and get the second one for only $1.99
cVGOSU6Ymg6mI2NOtlpw1g : First time eating here... Loved it . Had the bison burger on a multigrain bun . From the bun to the fixings everything was done perfectly. I will be back!!
H8XfaL4dh2Fggd1vJvLseg : I ordered the irish carbomb cupcakes thinking these would be special.  Turns out it tasted like an ordinary chocolate cupcake with a buttercream frosting.  Cakes were not even large sized, not even filled up in the baking cup.  Very ordinary with an exorbitant price.
QRq50fwDndezD-0BuJvcXw : Eid is such an awesome guy! He's a cal alumni with a great passion for electronics. He can literally get you anything from his libraries of catalogs. Prices are amazing too!
mcJZw9Cc7A2ptqRgRtGTMQ : Great gardens!  I honestly can't wait until I go again.  The rooms are divided by climate and location.  They have a great bonzai and orchid collection.  Make sure you check out the butterfly room!
x2R8cpuuSXQm3SuBvczTjQ : Love this place; discovered it through my cousin and been back quite a few times since. Their food is great and so is the atmosphere; they also have a full bar with some really tasty, delicious frozen sangrias which are highly recommended and quite affordable. The music isn't too loud too which is nice because you can have conversations without having to shout your way across the table.   Most appetizers are about 5-8 bucks and the entrees 12 to 20ish. The service is quick, the food tasty and they provide chips & salsa while you wait.
fEkRmzr31NPx_ptXXbdSmA : Im not trying to trash people who review here... but those of you that eat a lot of korean food... its probably one of the most expensive foods to eat.  Now u have koreana: one of the most inexpensive korean foods i have ever had and tastes good.  Do you want GOOD, FAST or CHEAP? In my opinion Koreana does a very good job at providing all 3.
GGL-qYNSZVhrzMuMakCLHw : The Ninety is like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde: During the day it is actually a fairly legitimate sports bar, at night it is an overcrowded and sweaty mass of students. If you are an undergraduate or recent USC graduate, you probably enjoy both sides of the coin. If not, it's probably best if you avoid The 9-0 past 9pm.  As far as sports bars go, I'm not sure there's a better one in downtown Los Angeles. Then again, I haven't done much searching. But they have a ton of flatscreens, and some decent bar food. The pizza is actually pretty good, and most of the other dishes I've tried have been at least OK.  What sets it apart, though, is the happy hour. Running from 4pm to 8pm (I believe), happy hour at The 9-0 features 2-for-1 drinks... Meaning two tall glasses of beer for $5. Not a bad deal at all, especially considering they usually have some legitimate beers on tap: Sam Adams seasonal, Pyramid, etc.  As a college dive, well... It seems like people are always bitching about The 9-0, but on any given Monday, Tuesday, or Thursday during the school year, there is bound to be a line out the door and around the corner. It gets PACKED on the inside, but that's all part of the fun... If you know at least a few of the people you're jammed up against.  It's entirely too expensive for a college bar, but I guess you can get away with that when you have a monopoly. Well cocktails will run you $10 a piece, but if you stick to specials you can usually get out without breaking the bank. On Tuesdays it's $4 for your first Miller Lite and $2 for refills... So if you reach the $10 credit card minimum, you should be good and drunk. Wednesdays are Jack & Coke night, and I think Thursdays are $0.99 Kamikazes... But I'm not sure. Word.
6_2_dAsrlJo55xvRZFw8tQ : Great cheese shops are scarce. It was thrilling to find this place in Claremont. The aroma of this quaint little place hits you on the sidewalk.  Inside, owners and sisters Lyddie and Marnie are simply delightful people that were happy to give us samples of cheeses from all over the world, including Sottocenere (ash-preserved cow cheese from Italy) and Austrailian Boxing Cheddar (sharp!). The shop offers a variety of other cool items including goat cheese caramels. Check out their selection of hard meats and beer (they carry Stone's Double Bastard Ale - saved  me a trip to Escondido!)
r4F7nbAZO6E-WbVtE8zFVw : Most thorough eye exam you'll ever get!   I have an astigmatism and severe nearsightedness. My soft contacts never really corrected them perfectly but Dr. Parreira is the only optometrist that listened to my complaints, got a thorough history, and corrected my eyes better than anyone else could.  They also do lasik evaluations and post operative care.
osCsmyXoSooEWW8gnL26-g : The Calvert House Inn has some of the best crab cakes in the area. They are huge and meaty; and the price is surprisingly reasonable. The wine list isn't extensive, but the bottles are cheap. The service is friendly and quick However, everything else on the menu is painfully average. Not bad, just plain and average.  If you go, get crabcakes (no sides, they even mess up mixed vegetables) and a bottle of wine. They have early bird specials, three courses for $12.95 if the order is placed before 5:50pm.
1l-TJiaaMwiujRgqy-Sxvw : This isn't a place you go to for atmosphere, this is the place you go to for awesome pie and great burgers. Walking in IS a flashback to some bygone era--the decor is very dated and has seen better days. BUT, look past that, sit down at a table, order some boysenberry pie and with your first bite you're transfered back to grandma's kitchen.   The pies are the most like homemade I've ever had at a restaurant. This isn't the Marie Calendar's style of pie, which is mass produced for consistency and loaded with sugar and preservatives. This is all-natural bliss. The pecan pie was my absolute favorite. Most pecan pies I've had at restaurants/bakeries are so sugary sweet they almost hurt your teeth to eat them and practically put you into a sugar coma. This one was not like that, it tasted like good homemade pecan pies I've had before. The boysenberry was also awe-inspiring.   We also got the burgers, my friend had a regular cheeseburger and I had a veggie burger. Both were very delicious! Again, these had the flavor of good, old-fashioned, homemade burgers. The buns were wonderfully soft and the toppings were tasty. I don't see how these can be compared with Inn-N-Out burgers because they're so different. Both are enjoyable, but you have them for different reasons according to what kind of taste you're in the mood for.  CONCLUSION: Wonderful place to go to for old-fashioned, homemade burgers and pies. Definitely worth experiencing and a place I will go back to again!
wBATg4KmZc3HtBhb9W__4Q : I had my 2007 Vegan wedding here in the Seaborg room.  They were accommodating on the menu. It was very affordable. The food was tasty and I love the way the room looks with the balcony. The staff was ok to work with. The wedding was held outside on the lawn facing the building and that was also very nicely done.
u2zewznpZtz4O8Anf57yEw : This past weekend, my sister and I trudged along through tiny rivers on the street about 6 inches high during the terrible downpour of rain we were having. We were soaked up to our thighs, and we did so just to get to Kismet.  Two petite girls ruffled up from the rain? We were pretty much a pathetic sight. We made our order, and then sat down to chat while we waited what was probably 15 minutes for our food. She got a roast beef shawarma student combo (5.55 with fries and a drink), while I ordered off the appetizer menu: stuffed grape leaves, fries, and hummus.  The food was amazing. I love their paprika fries (hot and crisp!) and stuffed grape leaves (sour and cool!). The hummus is decent because it's cheap and tastes great, although I've had better elsewhere. My sister thoroughly enjoyed her meal as well. Despite the weather and the wait, we were happy. The trip was definitely worth going through the rain and struggling to cross flooded intersections.  Service can vary sometimes, depending on who's working the register. The women are generally more genial, taking orders with a smile and willing to offer some suggestions if you can't make up your mind. On the other hand, the men are more stern and won't say much when taking your order, but other than their intimidating demeanors, they seem relatively harmless.  On a side note, my sister and I were extremely amused to see a Pita Pit employee come in--work uniform on and all--to get some food here. It's like... seeing a Quiznos employee order Subway. Weird!
99n6YDwx2dFzD1ZKXv9LVw : i miss this joint. they had stellar chive dumplings, generals tofu and i recall they once gave me an entire box of fortune cookies for 5 bucks which i lived on during a very poor summer of my life. i loved AP.
G8n0SmzAenJBuxnAcG-vHg : It is scary how well organized this place is! Worth checking out but beware of frequent shoppers that will elbow you and cause strange stock flows.  If possible - weekday mornings is the best time to go.
B2_2Zp31E-t1BGxr-ZCFXQ : The best food princeton has! Its just incredible! Any person who walks into  Hoagie Haven will come out with their mouth watering, ready to eat their delicious hoagie on the few benches out in front of the "college food shops". You can't just get half a sandwich, because that would only give you half a sandwich, and no one would want that! It is also not recommended that anyone whose watching their cholesterol should walk in (Heartstop is one of their best sandwiches) anybody who is anybody who happens to be in Princeton at lunch needs to stop by and try any of their incredible subs.
Ttqbxb8yBGx0RiN3Gx4EOw : I love veggie heaven. It is cheap, fast, and yummy. thai iced, protein 2000, and a curry bun and I'm all set. I love them so!!! they have cute $5 t- shirts too. parking sucks
hVZEYsqa3365z5dEnR_uFw : This is the quintessential coffee house - the random couches, the old-style chairs, the decadent decor, the good coffee and the sound of the espresso machine in the background.  I'm not a do-work-in-a-coffee-shop kinda guy, though, so I wouldn't bring my laptop  or a book. It's a good place to chill with friends on an afternoon for some coffee or tea or in the evening for some beer or wine. The food is pretty good. But, yeah, like Ameena G says, they used to have more crostinis and I really liked them! I always seem to go when there are too many people so getting a good spot is not always easy. The couches, while cool, aren't the most comfortable and not super conducive to having a chat with friends because you sit so far from them if they're not sitting next to you.  Still, it is a GREAT place to people watch and relax.
MgWN6mmQ70C9G4LrMCnVzQ : This is the place I first tried my very first crepe.. back in 03' or 04'.. I can't really remember BUT the crepes here are hella good. I've tried other crepe places and nothing will ever compare to Crepes A-Go Go. NOTHING. Anyway...  I tried ones with nutella, fruits, etc but what really puts a smile to my face is the sugar n butter crepes here. I think I just died and gone to heart attack heaven.. bahaha. JK.  The crepes here are pretty cheap too! Under $5! and the workers are friendly :) An absolute must if you're in the Berkeley area...
Ss3R1-TXQmhRleI2pTJWuw : Yummy lychee bubble tea + Christian propaganda = meh. I could do without the latter.
0Jv_nHYwD1AUg5c9RgVe3Q : This is my favorite ice cream place in the Greater Boston area, without question. I'm less thrilled about having to pay $4.25 per scoop, but the fact that I'm even willing to do so, even grudgingly (and furthermore, willing to make the trek out from where I live in JP, when I have a JP Licks about a half a mile walking distance from my apartment), speaks volumes about the quality.  The ice cream here is incredibly flavorful. You can really taste all the ingredients that went into it, as opposed to a lot of other ice creams, which seem to consist of mostly cream and sugar. My husband loves mango and often complains that most foods that purport to be mango-flavored really skimp on the mango flavoring. He, however, was quite pleased with Toscanini's mango sorbet.  Their ice cream tends to be on the rich side. The salted caramel ice cream I had today, while delectable and indulgent, was a flavor I just couldn't have too much of. I often feel the same way when I have their chocolate orange (my favorite flavor combination in the world).  The flavors they come up with are often quite creative (I had Guinness Ice Cream a couple years ago here - way better than it sounds). I particularly recommend the Earl Gray or the khulfi (cardamom). If you want something even richer, try their chocolate orange, Mexican chocolate, or various sorts of caramel flavors. They rotate their flavors though, so any of these flavors I've listed may not be on the menu at any given time.
KArZ061DwtSV8m4nYV3ODg : I went to La Belle after reading the reviews for waxing.  I have gone only twice for my eye brows.  The first time I was extremely satisfied.  Mina arched it and shaped it beautifully.  I normally go to Top Nailine at Fox Hills Mall because of the price, quickness and shaping... but Mina managed to arch my eye brows even more.  So, even though Mina's is twice as much (at $15) I didn't mind coming here because of how much she shaped it even better.  However, the second time, she didn't do AS good of a job as the first time... but still good.  It could have been my fault because I was late and she had another client after me... so maybe she rushed it, I don't know.  We shall see the third and fourth time around...but the first time was AMAZING.    I also did my first Brazilian EVER with her and I honestly did not know what to expect.  Mina was quick and kept reminded me to relax because I kept tensing up.  At first it wasn't as bad as I thought, then it progressively started hurting a bit more... but what can you expect?!?  It's a wax in a sensitive area.  I think over time, it will become less painful.. but overall... I was COMPLETELY satisfied with her and I plan on going back for this service as well on a routine basis.
l7M-WfiD8hlokeNroMmSaA : My friends and I dragged ourselves off the couch on a lazy Sunday evening for some good old Italian fare. We eschewed several local standbys for the comfort of our favorite chain. Why venture the half mile to Basta Pasta when you can have warm, mass-produced rolls at your fingertips? We were greeted by a confused young male who seemed to be unable to navigate his seating cart. He consulted his manager a couple times before seating us in a dark booth beside what looked like MIT freshman dorm night. We squinted at and pondered our menus before starting things off with some jazzed-up mozzarella sticks, and an assortment of house and caesar salads. The mozz sticks and the caesar salads were downright delectable but my friend's house salad was way iceberged out. My dining companion and I ordered a large pizza with fire-roasted red peppers, artichokes, and eggplant. Our server, Fleurian, waltzed the pie out proudly and said our pizza looked so delectable that he was tempted to sit right down next to us. The pie did not disappointed; the crust was cooked to perfection and the veggies were roasted evenly. My other dining companion ordered a side of rigatoni with red sauce for her entree and, much to our dismay, the pasta was cold! It tasted as if it had been sitting out for over ten minutes. But, polite diners that we are, we sucked it up and let Fleurian go about his Sunday night business. I'd return, though, to chow down on some of that top-notch pizza and to be seduced by Fleurian's dreamy smile.
X8MkcnFdpo8KUX30qC589Q : "5 for $6 `til 7-pm", what a catchy slogan! Their happy hour special is truly worth a try, especially for all us college students with not-so-deep pockets! :)  Happy hour is usually seated around the bar, and it does get kind of crowded if you go during popular dinner hours. When my big sis and I went around 5:30 it wasn't too busy, but the tables on the side were all taken so we ended up having to sit at the bar.   Picking up their menu, I was really surprised at the fact that they have a pretty decent selection of appetizers and drinks that you can order from. We ended up sharing a sweet chili calamari appetizer and we each got a Fleming's prime burger to indulge our guilty delights.   The calamari appetizer was delicious! Not only was it sweet & tangy, the portion size was generous!! I would definitely recommend!  Next up was our burgers. The patty was juicy and nicely cooked, and that thick strip of bacon just made it that much better! Drizzle the sauce over it and mmmmmmmmm....... (om nom nom nom)  All thanks to my big sis who took me here for an early dinner last Tuesday, this place has officially made my "I-don't-know-what-to-cook-tonight-let's-eat-out!" restaurant list. I definitely suggest you go HERE to enjoy a satisfying meal at a nice restaurant without leaving a large dent in your wallet! Delicious AND big portions, what more can you ask for?? :D
eAKc3Noe7MbcUsxlBidyvg : Pros: - Open long hours, from 11 am to 2 am every day of the week! - Friendly staff who smile and chat meaningful stuff with customers (two Asian men I've seen) - Lots of flavors and toppings - They have a banana yogurt flavor - Sample cups stored with the big cups that you get yourself - Cold yogurt - Creamy yogurt (my ideal consistency) - Free parking lot as well as street parking nearby - Convenient location close to Guadalupe and 24th - Cheap at 39 cents/oz and my total for the same amount was even less than at other froyo places that charge 39 cents/oz.... weird in a good way  Cons: - It's on the second floor of the small shopping center which means slightly delayed gratification - One-way street to enter their parking lot - Narrow corridor where the yogurt dispensers are; might be crowded if lots of customers are standing there deciding which yogurt to get
QeG1O1qfJhNbkQ0PyHJ-Kg : Visited sprinkles on 1/22/11. Waited in line about 45 minutes. Got the dark chocolate, milk chocolate, peanut butter, German chocolate & red velvet. I didn't think they tasted that great. They seemed the same as most other cupcakes I have tried at other cupcake shops. Definetly not worth waiting 45 minutes- wouldn't do that again. Glad I tried them & tasted them bur don't think I'll go back
i9111JHp3IwjRFODf9Ecag : OUT OF BUSINESS.  Replaced by Rolando's, a roast-beef-sandwich place.  Just really good hamburgers and fries.  I like the sundowner burger-- has a fried egg and chili on it.
6RZV8R8teu2M7TK9GXbHVA : This was the first place I went to for lunch because it was close to where I was stationed. The staff is very friendly (I mean it, the best staff ever!) and the food and drinks are very reasonable. There's also plenty of place to sit around both indoors and outdoors. Love it!
8YYPj950LnZF7F6SMSM0TQ : Wings are made to order. Nuff said. And they are DEE-LISH!!!
Oi1yXldKcxbBiVPB5dqp0A : I saw Green Day perform here once.  That night my friend slipped LSD into my other friend's drink and he had a horrible trip.  Poor guy, we had to babysit.    Anyways, The Bear's Lair is a great place to have a drink.  Right on the campus.  Have a drink with the college kids.  Ilove this place!
SaurKwaX4Nlu2FlLNOo0rw : I had a pizza delivered from pizza davinci soon after they opened. Honestly, it was the worst pizza I've had in a loooong time!  It was all wrong. Yuck. I haven't bothered with them since.   I recommend Bongiornos at the end of Oakwood Ave. They have the absolute best pizza in Troy.  EDIT: Bongiornos on Oakwood Ave closed a while ago. Too bad. The best pizza in Troy is now the notty pine on 15th street.
2jOilMd04yX7DSB5zWivZA : Don't know why most reviews give this place such low ratings... I'ts not great, but it's definitely decent... Been here a myriad times and never was disappointed. Yes, it's not a great place, but it's most solid, with good food and drinks..
hJ2_ruriwT_CZ3xuDJPfbw : Good, but not as good as all the hype lead me to believe.  Awesome burger selection but the burger itself has been surpassed (namely Christopher's on Mass Ave).    It seemed like they had a lot of self proclaimed "best" paraphernalia around the restaurant; best burger, best shake, best sweet potato fries, best onion rings, etc. etc.  Definitely worth at least one visit.
wVLKG2nof9AtLyNQTj4iJA : Came here on a Saturday night. There were plenty of empty tables throughout the night.  It is an "elegant yet casual" environment.  Upon entering, I wondered, am I underdressed?  But then I looked at some of the patrons there and concluded that no, I was not.  I ordered the Spaghetti ai Frutti di Mare which is described in English as "Spaghetti with Mixed Sea Food in a Light Tomato Sauce."  Their menu online lists it at $15.00 but it was actually $15.50.  I'm glad Cherie T already wrote a review so I can just copy and paste part of hers into mine. It contained "mussels, clams, calamari, shrimp, and bay scallops."  There wasn't much of each but with all of them combined, it was a satisfactory portion.  The portion size isn't that large compared to what you'd expect from the price, but if you take the restaurant's decor into consideration, it was a good amount.  I didn't leave feeling like I overate.  And if you're still hungry, just keep filling up on that good bread they have.  The servers were fairly attentive.  They kept coming by to fill up our glasses of ice water leaving me hydrated throughout the night.  I'd like to come back to try some other things on their menu.
l5fe0S7KvF2yeGdLXMIqHg : In principle, I'm happy when any new eating option appears in Kendall, particularly when they focus on fresh ingredients and creative choices, both generally absent here.    But Zigo's attempt falls short for me.  Lots of little plastic containers feature little servings gourmet this-and-that, but for the most part they're not all that special, and they're tiny servings for the price.  Furthermore, there are mishaps like the day they offered a free piece of fruit with lunch, and a lot of the fruit had gone bad.  Plus, I have to say -- when there are options for freshly coked food around, I find it a little unappetizing to be paying for stuff pre-made hours earlier and refrigerated in little plastic boxes.  It feels a lot like a glorified frozen dinner, and makes it feel a little like I'm eating at 7-Eleven.  Whatever you want to say about it, Zigo is definitely not what I'd call a "restaurant."  Want fresh, creative choices?  Walk two blocks to Aceituna instead.
w1EIMNifHVce3_zuA4t8Ew : I'm a Cal grad student and this is my default stop for a reliable meal of comfort food. I go there so often that the manager/owner/chef now recognizes me and knows exactly what I like to order. Prices are very reasonable, the people working there are friendly, and I've never had anything less than a satisfying, hot, delicious meal. I always leave full and happy. The shrimp with tofu and mixed vegetables is my usual - you won't be disappointed. Convenient location as well.
vwHvNV-_dP5Yk8RX8dj04A : This is my go-to place for lunch since it's the closest eatery to my class that gets out around lunch time. This place is more of a cafeteria than a restaurant. They do sell a wide variety of foods but it's a bit pricey. They try to incorporate international foods sometimes during the week. Some days they will have pho or thai lettuce wraps. One thing I really do like is the salad bar. I filled a big bowl of salad and toppings for a really low price compared to the ready-made ones you get at Sunshine Market or other places. Their soups are really good also, especially their chowders. Their "gourmet" section is kinda expensive for a small piece of dry chicken or fish. The "grill" is great if you're craving greasy food such as burgers, onion rings, fries, or chicken tenders. This place is good if you have no where else to go.
jC2-wuU9V-NYbxDcUyiw0A : This is a Harvard Square staple. While their burgers are on the smaller size, they are delicious.  You name it they have pretty much every type of burger imaginable with any type of cheese or topping. I went here with a burger club that I started and everyone enjoyed their burger. The meat to bun ratio was good, which is always the first thing I judge a burger by  Note, they do not take reservations and on a busy night you might have to wait outside.  We had a large group but simply went to a near by bar and had drinks until it was our time to sit.
IZLNDAmW1Q-e7kMNXgEV1Q : I come here constantly!  Food is consistently good and the prices are cheap. If you are a member of AA/United dining awards, you earn them here.  One star off for having random mishaps - like last night they had no limes or beansprout. WTF?
Rxgm7gHWDEV9UkOfloYZqQ : Best Italian in SLO in three years.  The meat sauces are very special.
lZ2vQXXsIvwsAQhgBAQ6Og : It is freeeezing.  Could you make it less cold?* No.  Could you put some blueberries and some strawberries in the same pancake?* No.  Could you put chocolate chips in the pancake?* Not today... just the special.  How about real butter instead of margarine? No, margarine is better for you. No, my dear, it is just cheaper to put on the table.  and it stinks.  and it makes the pancakes stink... why have i never noticed this before today?  Camel's Back meet Straw.  Thanks for keeping the 3rd Coast coffee filled.  *perhaps unreasonable requests... but MARGARINE, come on... that is so stinky, plasticky wrong.  (ALSO, just for scorekeeping, the scrambled eggs have varied wildly in my last 3 visits from slightly runny to overcooked to slightly moist. Bacon has been consistently chewy and oily - not crisp at all.  Pancakes - of course - are stellar but I am boycotting the stinky margarine. The coffee is bottomless but unlike sexy leather chaps,  it is mediocre.)
Skh4b2NgJuVHwoqLMAQ_1Q : Moe is fantastic!  I have been getting flowers from him for over five years.  I worked at Mills College in Oakland for a couple of years and drove to Berkeley to get flowers from Moe because his arrangement abilities and willingess to work with my budget were unparalled.  I am back at Berkeley and give Moe my business whenever I can!
xYXS-T-uWuqhTbCcqNgFdA : Ever since a friend introduced me to their wonderful insalata pizza, I've been a regular at Teresa's. Juicy grilled chicken breast, various sweet, bitter greens drizzled with balsamic vinegarette dressing on top of a hand tossed chewy, soft dough. I can eat this all the time!! They have simple good food and friendly servers.  Used to LOVE their linguini vongole but the taste changes depending on who's cooking that day so it can be a bit risky to try.  Other menus are all strong and dependable.
KdgZF6s_6Ly8I55Epx1Ixg : I had dinner at Matsuri about an hour ago and I figure I should probably write my Yelp review now before I completely forget the details of my meal here. First of all, I thought it was very cute (and a little awkward) when the waitress lightly pounded on the drums before we were seated at our table. I was also a little upset that she would not seat my friend and I at one of the tables with a booth seats. The restaurant wasn't busy at all and I really felt like she should have adhere to my request.   As for the food, this place did not disappoint one bit. I have no complaints. The sashimi we ordered was fresh, what more can I ask for? Probably bigger proportions, but whatevers. The eggplant with miso sauce was pretty tasty. I didn't know what to think of it when I took the first bite, but than I decided I kinda like the little bit of tang it had to it. The asparagus ( I forget with what sauce) was good. Simple as that. It wasn't particularly crunchy or deliciously yummy, just good. We also ordered a fried spanish baby mackarel. Hmm...I kinda like it. Likely battered (very lightly), not salted, with a little bit of lemon. Simple.   I think If I ever come back here again, I should probably read the Yelp reviews in details before I order my food. Maybe I'll be able to revise my review and give Matsuri one more star.
QgtWY6bcZ3DqcaB7hP5Esg : I'm going with three stars based mostly on their awesome patio and their heaping plate of nachos. Their beer list is great, but yesterday they were out of the first 2 that my friend ordered. Bummer, but not a big deal. We were all pretty irritated, though, when the house salad came drenched in Ranch dressing when we had requested two other dressings on the side--which were still brought out to us. The avocado and cheese melt came sans avocado, and we had to ask for a side to put in the sandwich ourselves. We were all a little more appeased after biting into the sandwich though--the bread was so sweet, chewy, and dense, it was absolutely delicious. I didn't even mind too much that my second beer took 20 minutes (the server forgot) because I was SO FULL. I'll be back for sure, but would love if they could step it up a little service-wise.
sGhw4H2gzW0psZom0QuZMw : When I close my eyes and dream, I taste and smell Almond Yogurt from Juicytart. I wholeheartedly believe that they developed this stuff just for my tastebuds alone. My poor wife had to sit here and listen to me marvel over this rich, sweet, tasty, decadent, delicious, amazalicious froyo. And it's one of the cheapest serve your own places you'll find.  It almost seemed wrong to taint the Almond yogurt, but they had some fresh cut peaches which looked so good I had to add them.  Not into mana from heaven in the form of Almond Yogurt? Their other flavors were pretty good too. As mentioned earlier, their topping selection is pretty astounding, especially for how much they pack into such a tiny area. It's probably the cleanest FroYo toppings I have ever seen.  Can't finish the review without mentioning the staff. They were so helpful and seemed to be having a great time. It was fun interacting with them and... oh wait, I'm thinking about the Almond Yogurt again, I have to go eat some right now, I'll chat with you later
N25N-1qcM8sMZjPMLOcp1w : The pizza was one of the best I have ever had. The crust was thin. I ordered a 18 inches with 3 toppings: artichokes, chicken and mushroom. I also order a full salad. Some drinks. The total came to around 30 bucks. Quite a bargain. That was enough to feed 5 skinny Asians. Well I could definitely eat more. But just enough was good too. Kept me from being overweight.  I like thinner crust. The pizza was hand tossed in front of the customers. The restaurant has a open kitchen design where customers can view the whole cooking process. I like that a lot. I think pizza tossing is like watching circus performance. Amazing.  But their specialty is their 23 inches pizza. The table next to us ordered that. Haha I almost couldn't believe it. One slice of the 23 inches pizza was just HUGE.  The decorations are based from the drama Godfather. The owner's father was a character on Godfather. The Italian music they played were smoothing. It was quite a positive experience. I would definitely go back more often when I visit my bro.
ewXhQ71ijTbJMM8C1HNrPw : I just love the name. Filling food for the poor starving college student.
Cu3u72q3Smdt3RqTVcFicw : I hate to rain on this parade but this place is overrated. And its not "Asian fusion," its 90% Thai food and Thai flavor. That said, the food is decent, and the prices aren't ridiculously "upscale."  Basically this is the kind of Thai restaurant that's small, cute, clean enough for white people (a la stuffwhitepeoplelike.com).  Foods not bad, just not awesome. Service was a little slow, and their designated "waiting area" is a bench by the smelly bathrooms.
NRxkAzUD3UC8YEETVShgNw : There was a time when I once frequented the Sunshine Store on campus for coffee. This was when I thought coffee was the foulest drink to have ever slid down my throat. How bitter the taste was. How disgustingly vile. But I had no choice. I needed caffeine in my system. It was a necessary evil. As I swallowed down those accursed cups of coffee from Sunshine Store, I had to swallow my pride too.  But then one day, I discovered The Art of Espresso and they showed me that black coffee can be found at cheap affordable prices AND be delicious! Not only delicious but beyond that! Their coffees are exquisite and divine! Indeed, they have turned brewing coffee into a beautiful form of art!  And their Vietnamese coffees are delicious as well. But I think the highlight has got to be those magical macaroons they have sitting in that jar near the cashier. I shan't rest 'til I steal the recipe for myself because those things are like little morsels of heaven!
9Fht3rzJPuF3OwBr9c3R1w : Long lines! Ugh!   But I did find two pairs of shoes and comfy bath shoes as well... but yeah... the lines are ALWAYS long! OMG.   SHOES: The reason I came here... they didn't have much of a summer selection but they did have a lot of heel shoes. And basketball shoes - I saw LeBron's brand shoes!   They have Shape Ups too! For $30... they are usually $100 from Spencer's! Wow.   Not a lot of workout shoes... I saw some LA Gear and occasionally some Reebok, but not much. I used to find Asics, Nike, etc... but now not so much because it's summer. :sigh:  Overall... the stuff is fine for a good price!
bzvXp57czqx1EKclqcGZ7Q : I went here last weekend for a charity event, so I didn't really get a true experience. But, it is a great space with a good vibe and I look forward to checking it out again. I hear they are still building the stage area, so once the sound gets fixed that should really help out. I wasn't crazy about the parking (cones so you can't park in the street, with an attendant offering $5 for the dark lot around the corner or $10 for a proper spot) or the drink prices ($9 for a tiny cocktail is a little steep for somewhere off the beaten path like that). The staff was very friendly though, so a good event will get me back in there for a second try. I haven't tried the food yet which could swing my review either way.
FwQotCMsy1r8YO0mvD0ikg : La Baguettes sandwiches are the best! i love the turkey with cheese and butter! its so yummy! I've only had a couple of their desserts and they were pretty good. but if you want a great sandwich for a great price go to La Baguette!
-7qTCOqjDYW80fPRpA3sJw : My mom, sister and I stopped by to hae a light lunch before we resumed moving the sis into her apartment. This place was a perfect spot for just that. I had the curried chicken salad on wheat. I make my own curry chicken salad and make a million mental notes of what to change to make it more like this one! The chicken salad wasn't dripping in sauce. It had just enough to keep it moist and flavored well. My mom had the zog chicken salad and she too was saisfied. The only negative is that my sis ordered the reuben and they had run out of sauerkraut. On well! Definitely a cute, college cafe and a lot of charm and tasty food!
U4G05z1_cGN6rC3SYf8tlA : People who whine about the prices should be deported. It's the most delicious of all that is delicious. They will also let you try anything in the entire store, including the expensive vinegars and olive oils.
jjkZJp6xPBdEjJi-4a9FOQ : I am diggin Area Four.  It is right in the heart of MIT.  I sat at the bar and the bartender Oliver was a great person to have as a server.  I ordered the Mac and Cheese.  The flavor was great but the portion was a bit small so I give it four stars.  I had a couple of the beers they have on tap.  They have a nice selection of micro-brews which Oliver tells me they will rotate.    Next time I go I am going to try the soft serve ice cream they make there, the flavors the day I went did not excite that much.  The venue and location are worth five stars.  The service is five stars.  If the price to portion ratio were a little better I'd have given them five stars.
DpXzFAZrhDS7kHufGSNGUA : I have to declare a nostalgic bias towards Intermezzo. As a college student this was a place I'd go when I was blowing it out. Lines used to go out the door (do they still?) and I would get my roast beef sandwich with horeseradish/dijon mustard on the  house made sunflower seed bread. Even though it was huge I'd always polish the damn thing as my metabolism was insane in those times. Salads served to you in what should be the mixing bowl not a serving. If I could only move Intermezzo somewhat even remotely close to where i live now I'd by hitting it up religiously

Now add 20. Now add another 1000. Now add 10. What is the total?            Answers:  1. B, Wednesday night. I've never been to any other trivia places, but the trivia atmosphere here seemed a little tame. Score updates weren't given regularly and the prizes were ok. 2. C, Sizzler. Oh how I miss thee! 3. 200^2 + 300^2 = C^2. C = 360.56ft. 4. No. If you jaywalk this portion of Rte. 1 you are either insanely drunk or I'm shocked that you lived long enough to gain admission to UMCP. 5. A, Su loves meat and College Students love beer. The love affair is unabashed and often unhealthy. Since VG has good beer, college students flock to this place. 6. False. Trick question. Even though there are a lot of students here, remember, it's a college town, so the fact that the place is packed has almost nothing to do w/ the quality of the food. 7. A - only if you eat it raw, and if you eat raw ground beef, you're dumb and deserve to get this question wrong. B, most estimates say that you lose about 32% when cooking meat. This is the correct answer. C, what are you, Jesus? If you can cause meat to multiply, I need to be your BFF. D, this is the size of a McD's beef patty. 8. E. Joe Bloggs! 9. F! It should also taste good! The ribs here were tender but didn't taste too good. 10. D. The more TVs, the better. It was puzzling that some of the TVs weren't broadcasting an HD signal. B1: 2nd Place. If you pass the second person and you take their place, you are second B2: Dummy. How can you pass the last person? B3: Did you get 5000? It's 4100. Check w/ a calculator.  So how'd you do? Terrible? That's ok. Just go to Varsity Grille and get your drink on. It's the college thing to do. Average food, nice, spacious interior, friendly service, and beer. What more can college students ask for? Oh, you want specials? Here you go: Drink Specials, e.g., $2 rails HH 4-7 $0.50 wings and shrimp + special beer pricing Mon: Kid's Night (kids under 12 eat free w/ each paying adult) + Texas Hold Em Tourney @ 7 & 10pm Tue: 1/2 price bottle wine + AYCE pasta Wed: Trivia night Thu: Lady's Night - $3 Blue Moon and Margarita's & $6 Martini's and Cosmo's Fri: Karaoke Night Sat: Live Music Night
OtN2UZzZa22MWha59hdrtw : They have good coffee here. Its cool if you have an early start to a day. The only reason I cant give it a 5 star is b/c the pastries aren't the best. I like the flaky but stuck together feel of good pastries like choc croissant, or regular croissant. Its a little more doughy here on the chocolate croissant and almond croissant.  But the bread is really good. It comes out of a cool oven, that is controlled with a wheel positioning the bread in the oven changin the distance from the fire. Order it and get some jam and bread and coffee.  -the good life-
cf4VE8acZ2fHxasamhXzxg : CLOSED  from Buzzsaw: No Radio is No More  Local music store victim of changing buying trends  By:Julissa Trevino  Tucked away around the corner from Collegetown Bagels on Seneca St., No Radio Records opened about two and a half years ago. It has served as a record store, an art gallery--displaying work by local artists and college students--and a stage for local acts. Many college students have made the trek to the store for both the music and atmosphere.  Cornell junior Sam Moghadam says he often visits No Radio Records and supports the store more by attending shows than buying CDs or records. "I think it's a really great cultural part of Ithaca, especially in regard to music," he says. "It's a really intimate environment, which I think is usually the best environment for music."  But soon, No Radio Records' customers will have to make their last visits. While one of only four independent music stores in Ithaca, No Radio Records will be closing March 13. "The global economy has sort of tanked over the past few months and the effect of this on a business that was already on a shoestring budget has been... well, not so great," said owner of No Radio Records Bob Proehl in an official statement about closing the store. "The store has always paid its own bills, broken even, if you will. But not a whole lot more than that," he says.  According to The New York Times, more than 900 record stores closed in the U.S. between 2003-2006. The situation for major chain stores hasn't gotten any better: The Times Square Virgin Megastore, home to the largest music, games, video and DVD inventory in the world and one of the biggest attractions in New York, will close this April.  With the increasing numbers in digital downloading and the Internet as a venue for music, the music store may be disappearing. Proehl acknowledges the Internet as a massively available source for music. Still, he remains optimistic about what the future holds for music stores. "There's a sort of backlash and people come back around to vinyl for various reasons," he says. "There is a need for innovative, forward thinking stores that are pushing the idea of what a record store can be and responding to what the community wants and needs."  "This is no Borders," says Stephen Burke as he sits at his computer behind two tables covered with tapestries. Burke opened Small World Music, which has a simple set-up and offers a variety of genres, in 2001. Burke said independent record stores offer an experience people can't get at chain stores.  Ithaca's other two record shops are Autumn Leaves, which primarily sells books, though its basement is stacked full of used vinyl for very affordable prices, and Volume Records, which has moved its vinyl into the second floor of Petrune, while its CD inventory remains in the same location on the Commons.  "The challenge to running a store this size is really trying to decide and figure out what you can offer that some place like Best Buy can't because it's not necessarily going to be price, and in some cases, it's not going to be selection," Proehl says.  SoundScan, an information system that tracks the sale of music and music video products in the U.S. and Canada, reported that in-store album sales dropped 17 percent in 2007, while digital purchases increased by 50 percent. But indie music stores offer knowledgeable staff, rare and local finds and a warm environment. And Bruce Burch, administrative director of University of Georgia's music business program, told Athens.com last year, "Vinyl is and will continue to make a comeback."  Burke said IC students visit Small World Music to find old and cheap vinyl. "We have a good number of college students who come down, I think, partly, to be part in the environment of a store like this," says Burke. "They'll buy loads of old vinyl for a dollar a piece just to hear more music."  Colleen Goodhue, an IC senior, visits Volume Records because of the local artists the store carries. "I don't really buy CDs anymore, but I do buy CDs if it's something local. And this is the place to get it," she says.  "It's a completely different experience," Burke says about indie music stores. "There will always be a need for a public place where people's own individual love of music is reflected... We're really here for people who love music and think about music everyday."  For Bob Proehl, it's more practical than that: "My hope is that for other stores, this is an opportunity to spotlight what they're doing better than anyone else and remind people why these smaller stores exist to begin with," he says. "When you buy, think local first. Amazon.com will be just fine without your business; the shop on the corner might not be."  No Radio Records will close March 13 with an evening performance by Dufus, who also played at the store's opening, and Jeffrey Lewis, making his first performance in Ithaca.
qUQ84u8gjQ0aMyjI1tq_Tg : This place feels like a chain because it is a chain, its located in nine states. The place used to have the ridiculous name of "Beaners" but was recently changed (long over due).   The atmosphere kind of feels like a warmer Starbucks with carpet. The staff is super friendly so be prepared! And the coffee is not that great but service is good.  The good thing is this place has free wi-fi access. And some pretty decent breakfast bagels. They usually have really good coupons, so keep your eye out. They also have a punch card to work your way to a free coffee!
sl2INdhozCQo_xwa2rhM9g : GREAT service, the second my water is half-full, the staff doesn't hesitate to fill it quickly and quietly without interrupting my devouring of delicious  sushi.  The blue moonlight is my favorite, although they have MANY choices. Happy hour is the best time to go, and parking stinks a little bit, but hey, i'd rather park behind someone than pay $10 parking downtown.
WXCASkNVUsndL47xj6nBlw : The food here is good, not great.  I come here very rarely since I HATE the customer service. Tips should be earned. The servers here do not realize this, they assume that a 20% tip is the standard, even for bad service by waitresses who ignore you or get you a clean fork with a bad attitude.  Once, I paid by debit card at the register and put $0 for tip. The cashier saw this and gave me the nastiest look, then asked if I had left a tip at the table. I had indeed left a cash tip, but then felt that I should have taken it back since the server was rude and so was this cashier.  Always remember to check your bank account to make sure that they have not taken more money than you had signed for. My friend said that this has happened to her before.
X5Zdx_llFL2frn5-EUF_HA : My boyfriend and I had left a restaurant on 45th earlier in the evening after waiting for 25 minutes to get noticed... so we started driving towards the U-District. I was very glad that we did.   I saw Malabar and instantly started craving Dosas!  We were immediately greeted and asked how our days were (very friendly staff). My boyfriend ordered some beer from India as I ordered the chai.   They had an economy menu as well for students and people on budget which I thought was smart, however I just was craving dosa, sweet crepe like and curry potato filling dosas!  We ordered some vegetarian samosas to start. Hands down these were the best that I had ever had in the area, and we eat a lot of Indian cuisine. You could tell that they were fresh and hand made. The dough felt like an Australian pie not hard and definitely not greasy like so many restaurants. It came with homemade sauces with pipping hot perfectly cubed potatoes and peas inside.   We both ordered dosas. I had the masala dosa whereas my boyfriend had the vegetable dosa which also had tofu inside. The service was incredibly quick! We received two large plates with lentil soup on the side.   I kept tearing the crispy crepe-like meal and dipping it into the various sauces we had on the table, mixing and matching exploring the taste possibilities.   The waitress was sweet and brought us two boxes and bowls to save our soup and dosas. Needless to say they are waiting patiently in the fridge at the moment while the spices marinate for my wonderful South Indian lunch tomorrow!
5obpi6KCuKOjIHoLT_oJnA : $150 for room $100 for UMass gear Who knows how much on food  Getting all nostalgic - priceless
dpisIKk227e0gaOaPbOlew : YUM!  i love mediterranean and this place did not disappoint.  we were just in town for the afternoon and used your friendly ol' neighborhood yelp to find a place to grab a quick bite. we found this gem and decided to check it out.   we couldn't decide what we wanted, so my boyfriend got the falafel plate and i got the chicken shawarma and we split em up. the chicken was delicious and the falafel was unlike any i'd had before. it was so tasty and very moist on the inside [we all know dry falafel is a turn-off]. they have an extensive wall of drinks, too, including beer.   their prices are quite cheap given the serving size and the quality of food. they make their own pita right there and it is delish!   when we went up to pay afterwards, we were all given a fresh homemade piece of baklava - on the house since it was our first time! now that's how you do business!  although we are a few hours south of this little family joint, we will most certainly make it a point to stop by when we pass through town next!  thanks, jaffa!!
qQmc8IC8b4sa667uPejUEA : This is my favorite Korean place in the UC Berkeley-campus area -- better than Steven's Korean and Gomnaru. The portions are large, the beef is sufficiently tender and juicy (my standards for $6 food are not too high), and the service is pretty fast, and the price is cheap. Wish they would take credit/debit card and accommodate for my perpetually cashless state.   It's a pity that they're always closed on Sundays, though. Religion can be so inconvenient.  EDIT! No longer closed Sundays, but hours are reduced I believe.
uVH-RinB8nsVYyy_PvX-Fg : I've been to the lunch buffet a few times and ordered off the menu two times for dinner. I honestly think this is the best place in ann arbor for Indian food. Medium spicy actually has a nice low burn, and everything looks carefully prepared and not sloppy. The buffet is one of the better ones in town, with many vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes. Even the buffet food is flavorful and decently spicy. And complimentary fresh dosa!  Another plus - very affordable. I think this is the cheapest weekday Indian lunch buffet in town. Items off the menu are not too pricey either.  Service has ranged from very helpful and friendly to a little flustered, but never rude.   It doesn't hurt that this place is right across the street from where I currently work... reminds me to go to this semi-hidden gem on state st. You should go too!
X0L1fWf99KHdFAS75alhDA : I came here after eating lunch elsewhere so I wasn't particularly hungry. However, a few things stood out on the menu:  1.) Clam Chowder soup. 2.) Sweet Potato Fries.  Okay, so I've definitely had better clam chowder before...on the West Coast, I'm thinking probably in Monterey. Perhaps there are better places to get this kind of stuff on the East Coast. I ordered a cup of this and it was on the salty side. Rawr.   As for the sweet potato fries, they were fine when they came out fresh. After a while of them sitting there, they were on the soggyish side. So I would probably suggest cooking them for longer so that they are on the crispy side when they get cold.  I also grabbed from fries from someone else's plate. Surprised much? Well, yes, I grab from other people's plates...with permission of course. So these were onion ring fries. They were pretty good. Crispy and not too onion-y.   Minus one star for not having a public restroom. Is this even legal?   P.S. Think twice before naming your burgers. The people you name them after may be vegetarian/vegan. That is why I was surprised to see a Natalie Portman burger. She would be offended. Shame on you, Mr. Bartley.
9CQistg2FxR88jiqHwRNTg : Le sigh.    I wanted to have some satisfying french toast/pancakes/something sweet for breakfast and we decided to go here as it is within about a 5 minute walk of where I am staying.   I ordered the raisin french toast.  They make their own bread so I was looking forward to some amazing french toast.  In my opinion, the french toast was dry and not very flavorful.  I solved this problem by using lots of butter and syrup but I feel like those 2 things should be used to accentuate french toast instead of make it edible.  It wasn't bad, but, if you are looking for really moist tasty breakfast, perhaps look elsewhere.  Our waitress was also grumpy.  She wasn't rude necessarily, but she seemed to be hardly going through the motions and had already turned to the next person to take their order when the previous person was still talking.  I decided to use the restroom before I left.  The bathroom was dirty and looked like it hadn't been cleaned all morning.    Overall, this is an okay place but I will try an alternate option for breakfast the next time I'm in Ann Arbor.
pbHRlzfeW8ihFL_BX6lMwQ : I used to love Papmingos, it was my favorite frozen yogurt shop in Berkeley, but after the management changed the quality has as well.  The yogurt that used to be smooth and creamy is now icy and runny... and the toppings always seem expired or stale.. perhaps it is b/c the lack of customers.  The workers are still super nice but I would not go back again...
vG6PwSSELCpLInK9c7Es2w : We had breakfast here. Overall the food was good, not great. Portions were small but it was enough for my family, just didn't match the prices. Don't think we will be back
5tQQBVeBNg3ndKjeH4tptA : Ever since my first time having their hummus as a wee child, I have been looking for a sold in store version that I could enjoy when not in Pasadena. So far that search has been an epic fail.   The chicken here is unlike any other. Chicken is so simple and yet the way the people at Zankou prepare it is better than the rest. To top it all off you have the garlic sauce to dip it into. You find yourself having more sauce than chicken in some cases.   My hubby had the shish kabob plate. This was a plate full of goodness. It came with rice, hummus, meat and some of their pickled vegetables. It takes 10 minutes to prepare the kabob plates, but it was worth it. He ate until he could eat no more.
-m0rJjK69WZFUIOC9BS53Q : I got my septum pierced here this weekend, and was very happy with the experience. Everyone I dealt with was very friendly and helpful, from the jewelry gallery counter to the Chameleon counter to the piercer, and the piercing itself came out great and was pretty much completely painless. Greg did the piercing, and everything was quick and simple and he definitely hit the "sweet spot" because I didn't even feel the needle go through. While the piercing plus the stuff to clean it was a bit pricey (in all, I spent about $100), I imagine they're not any cheaper elsewhere, and I felt good about what I was getting.
uwwdG2mAz632OV5_3F0u8w : Fast service. Every order is correct. Food is always fresh and filling!
zQc6FPBCfEu2k21kMX6IHw : Like many others, I was anxiously awaiting the opening of Sprinkles in La Jolla because I wanted to see if these cupcakes were indeed heaven sent!  I am a fan of Cupcake Wars so I watch Candace Nelson herself judging cupcakes.  It's time I judged hers!    I know a lot of people rave about their red velvet but honestly, I didn't grow up eating red velvet so I don't know a good from bad when it comes to that flavor and I just don't get it.  Is it chocolate?  Is it vanilla?  I don't have a clue...  So I digress...  The line was not that long and I had never been and my husband and I had to order pretty quickly so we did make the mistake of ordering mostly chocolate cupcakes but since that's my favorite, I didn't care!  We got a dark chocolate (decent), a chocolate marshmallow (disappointing), a chocolate with coconut (probably my favorite of the four) and a lemon (second favorite).  Four cupcakes for $14...yep, you read that right...and as crazy as it is, we still bought them.  The place is not exactly near my house and we knew we wouldn't go back soon so we were splurging.  Overall, they were pretty good.  I wouldn't rush back anytime soon and I'm not sure what the fuss is all about but they were pretty good.  I love to bake and these just didn't taste that special to me and knowing what it costs to actually bake a cupcake, I'll be whipping up a batch before driving all the way to La Jolla.  This place is popular because of the stars that eat them and the press that they get due to them eating them.    The customer service was excellent and yes, the packaging is cute but overall taste was just good so I would save your money and bake some yourself!
VDxLmNFHceQCWC9_Cvw5_Q : Julissa cuts my hair - she does great layering. I thought I had a funky shaped head or something since no one has seemed to be able to layer my hair correctly until now.  Highly suggest.
Lj1Mv0vGyxUMD1q3cnZ6sQ : Bear's Ramen House is one of the places I will miss after I officially graduate from Cal and move away. It is located right in Durant Square (or what students refer to as Asian Ghetto). I usually order the Mushroom Fried Noodle/Rice or the Kimchi Fried Noodle/Rice with Spam. I prefer the noodles over the rice though. Both come with an egg right on top and costs about $7-8. Eat it when it's fresh! Like Ava S. says, the quality of the food really depends on who is cooking that day. I am most satisfied with the food when the lady who owns the store is cooking. I think her son and a non-Asian woman is usually working the store now, but not always. The owner is seriously the nicest and sweetest lady ever! You can even CALL IN ahead of time to place your order if you're on the run.  If you want to dine-in, I must warn you that it is pretty small. I think there's only about 6-8 seats in there total, but you can always sit at the tables outside of the store. I would definitely NOT sit in there on a hot day. Complimentary water and CASH ONLY (but there's a Bank of America right around the corner if that helps).
JPWBTclCU4G0ZoQxRnuodQ : This was my favorite pizza place when we lived in Troy. We enjoyed both take out and eating at the restaurant. Sad to see it gets such bad reviews.... I'd say give it a chance. It is way better than the "New York" style pizza.
mG6_c00UQyHvzV6RZx6oug : BEST BURGER I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE!!!!  I've only been here once when I was visiting San Luis Obispo with my boyfriend who wanted to show his favorite places to eat when he was a college student at CALPOLY. The burger I had was so tasty. My boyfriend also likes the Tri-tip sandwiches here.  This place is was packed with college students. Definitely a happening place for that age group.  I can't wait to come back here when I am in town to try all the other good stuff all the other yelpers are raving about.
yzzwFvr8qoa6zqqVu-eRXA : The hours! The hours!   I would support this place based on the realistic hours alone, even if it meant chewing on cardboard and sipping on watered down gasoline.  Fortunately for me, that's not the case.  They have a wide and interesting selection of coffee, drinks and food.  Vegetarian options galore! The menu is full and I always have a hard time deciding what I want to try next.    I will admit  the food is a notch better than good but not great and it's a little pricey for what it is.    I've never had a bad meal there so there's something to be said about that.     A great thing about this place is the service.  I've never found the usual "oh my god, I hate my life and you're not cool enough to order coffee from me" attitude I usually find at little cafes such as these.    The girls here are almost always friendly and helpful. I may just grab some breakfast right now..
Qgif0JHs-mhoj7vYtP0Jcg : When I heard from fellow Yelpers that the burgers at Bocado rival that of my favorite at Holeman & Finch, I knew I had to check it out.  I went with a friend the next evening without a reservation.  Probably not a good idea, especially since it was a Friday night, but the restaurant appeared half empty when we walked through the front doors.  All tables inside were reserved, but we were able to be seated immediately on the patio, which was fine by us.  The burger at Bocado is called the "Bocado burger stack" and it's hard not to compare it to the H&F burger because they are so similar.  Like the H&F burger, the Bocado burger is served with a side of fries and ketchup.  The Bocado burger is similar in size to the H&F burger and uses H&F buns.  However, the buns at Bocado have sesame seeds on them while the burger at H&F does not.  The Bocado burger is also $12 compared to H&F's $10.  OK, enough with the comparisons.  The Bocado burger is a double patty burger with two slices of American cheese, housemade pickles, and a little bit of mayo.  The meat is made from short rib, beef brisket, and organic ground beef.  The cheese melts right into the bun and meat.  The burger is tasty, juicy, and almost melts in your mouth.  It's simply excellent and is indeed a worthy rival to H&F's burger, IMO.  Every bite is delicious.  Creative Loafing named Bocado's burger the best burger in Atlanta in 2010.  I'd like to come back and try other items on their menu.  Their menu is just one page and you can tell they emphasize quality and focus on local ingredients.  The restaurant itself has been open for about a year and a half now.  It's not too large in size, but does feature a bar and, as mentioned above, an outdoor patio.  The interior design is modern and simple.  Our server was friendly and knowledgeable, although service was slow towards the end as business picked up.  The restaurant reached capacity by the time we left around 8pm.  Valet parking is available, although we just parked on 8th St. right next to the restaurant.  Unlike Holeman & Finch, this is more of a sit-down restaurant and not a pub, so reservations are recommended.
dZ5luBQRaqiTQy5MS1hkBg : Great time to come for a really cheap lunch. They have specials with an individual sized 1 topping pizza and wedge salad for only about $6. Very filling. Not really that big of a fan for dinner since the place is really small and not that special.
8RZoKXa4G9iTqImLf7ME7g : I've been here twice, and both times our servers have said that they recommend 3-4 plates per person. Are they insane? Last night, we had 10 plates for 5 people, and we *still* walked out with leftovers.  Delicious food for vegetarians and omnivores alike: the scallops, huarache con hongos and the quinoa tacos were standouts for me (yes, I tried a scallop. sorry, mr. scallop, you were tasty!) The staff and manager were very gracious about the one dish that had some issues (extremely salty guacamole), and remade it for us.  The decor and the food are only Mexican if you send Mexico to a space colony on the moon in the future and take some LSD to boot. If you want Abuela's chilaquiles, wrong spot. If you want some creative, tasty cuisine in a fun space (cars! swings! giant nests!), right on.
z-qfFEDUwkEiFVxkc1aO4g : excellent looking expensive chocolate store in the four seasons that obama loves... so of course i had to come here!    service was very nice considering how i was so indecisive... so i ordered a few pieces that i shall report back once i taste it... they let u choose ur cute ribbon wrapping which is also nice!    the fig chocolate covered ganach filling was 5.50... it was ridiculous but well worth the price as i ate already have of it... it has a crunchy aspect to it due to the fig seeds and then is further complemented by the creamy sweet ganache filling... the chocolate outter layer i found unnecessary and broke apart as soon as i try to cut into it... this fig was fine with just the ganache filling!  can't wait to try the famous salt caramel!
-9yseH9xMHVb7S_BLNnzOg : I remember walking past this restaurant as a high schooler wondering what the hell it was. Something about getting good grades I guess. I didn't know that is was a glorious, vegetarian haven.  I am a new vegetarian, and this restaurant made my conversion so much easier. It's affordable and it's right by campus! Big A Burger Combos are one of the greatest deals in history, ranking only slightly above the Louisiana Purchase. Veggie patty, choice of garlic fries or normal fries, and a drink. Oh sweetness.   I've also tried their delicious Gourmet Burger with a veggie patty and pesto sauce. That shit is good, but the burger combo is pretty much bomb for any starving college student.  Their big salads are great too. They're huge! And they come with that sweetass golden brick of cornbread.   Don't worry, they cater to carnivores as well. Sweet deals all around. Eat! Enjoy! Eat again!
TZwzW2H76yejDK8rKouh7g : A must stop if you're trolling the highways and biways of Indiana. The Triple XXX is not, like it sounds, an adult bookstore, but rather a cute little diner/hamburger joint named for the signature root beer they sell. A stone's throw from from Purdue University, many of the burgers are named for Boilermaker football players, including the Bernie Flowers All-Pro and the Duane Purvis All-American, which is a cheeseburger with a spread of creamy peanut butter on the bun. Very friendly staff and plenty character (and characters).
rmjxbR77GObX8PAsmMqRdw : I came here with a party of seven on Saturday night at 8pm. We had to wait about 20 minutes (which wasn't so bad for the time and number of people) outside in the rain because the place is so tiny inside. Once we got inside it was super cute and they gave us water and bread with delicious olive oil right away which helped a lot. After we ate it up in 2 seconds they brought us more :)   Dishes were good. Out of the seven dishes on the table, three were the lasagna which was awesome. Very cheesy, but not too heavy - perfectly smooth. Someone ordered the special pumpkin ravioli with sage - great. Another ordered the shells with broccoli rabe - she was happy. BF ordered the fussili with chicken and vodka sauce and that was the only dish that was so-so because the sauce was bland.   The dish sizes were decent. We weren't hungry leaving, but we also didn't have left overs. If I was in the neighborhood again I would go back for the lasagna.
j2NC4_mi1IO7UEHe9SYKdg : I had a big event last night and went to Jessi for an updo. I'd previously met with her for a consultation for the big night - she was very polite, knowledgeable and helpful and I ended up getting my hair cut by her a couple weeks before the event as well. She's a great cutter and stylist - make sure to ask for her for regular cuts and special events.
JzA1CdyE22vOWDSgTO3ouA : I ordered for delivery because I was too lazy to go grocery shopping / cook. Plus Glee was on!  It's convenient because they actually deliver to the USC area, but it took forever for them to actually take my order. I kept being hung up on.  I ordered penne with meat sauce and a chopped salad ($10 min for delivery). The meat sauce had way too much sodium, so I HAD to use the bread to kinda soak it up. But the bread's awful. It's hard and just not good.  The chopped salad - do not like the turkey in it. Planning on saving it for my lunch tomorrow. I think it'd be fine without the turkey and adding some fresh mushrooms and using my balsamic vinagrette dressing.  Overall, not the best. But I know I'll use it again because it's just convenient.
eX1lLCwLHG8aMFS06ymi3A : Disgusting place of dooooommmmmmm.. Don't go here on your lunch break, especially if you're in a hurry. Sure they have a big plate of fries for a dollar but the 45 minutes it takes them to make you these fries is not worth it. This places smells awful and is just...ick gross. The employees are creepy and theres always a weird old man lurking around the counter in a dirty apron.
fL2xTCo0otJcsg4fvPZyTw : Still the best Thai food I've had to date.  Each thing is rated 1-5 stars for hotness, and they don't mess around with the spices here. Of course, a little Sriacha sauce on the side doesn't hurt...
AqeraTdiucM-SuCUg9uDug : Like any other Chipotle, everything tastes pretty standard.  It is a chain so that's expected.  And like every other Chipotle, whenever you order food, to the people working behind the counter never, ever listen to what you want to eat.  But they usually get at least 80% of your order right haha.  Maybe it's because of the noise or the madness of lunch rush, but this always happens.  I don't mind getting spicy sauce instead of mild because they couldn't hear me once in a while.  It can get really rowdy and loud in there when everyone and their mom decides that they want Chipotle.  I guess that's what you get for eating on the drag, especially during rushes.  Anyways, it's definitely a keeper and a good place to go for consistently good food.  It can get really rowdy and loud in there when everyone and their mom decides that they want Chipotle.
cClbwzoPV475icc30HihtA : Huevos rancheros was not all that. Its missing some ingredient. Not satisfying. I won't come back here.
YgkqByRy-pYNIP8xFQvCIg : The selection of items was very well edited and organized. They had a lot of Golden-Girls-looking sweaters and sequined tops, but for the most part the pieces could work today. Sizes are totally hit or miss and the staff is spaced-out, but it's a good shop to hit.
3vzBOKshUopT7ASlQEydcg : Great menu selection and fondue, elegant ambiance, a full calendar of events for an awesome evening every night they're open. Most people usually find themselves wandering to the outdoor patio and stuck at the gas powered, crystal rock and brick fire pit. Getting caught up in conversations with people you would have otherwise never met before is half the reason to go!
v8uXP3ZhwlMdGO2QZSk-HQ : Before I came to top dog I was not a big fan of hot dogs. After I came... yepp, still not a fan. This is one of those joints where everyone has to at least try once if they go to Cal. Well, I tried it once and that will be about the only time I ever go there. A buddy of mine had told me that he wasn't to fond of hot dogs, but he came here and liked it. I ended up going with his recommendation of the chicken apple dog. My recommendation is to just go to costco and buy a bulk pack of chicken apple sausages and save yourself the hassle.   Heaven forbid you don't know what's on the menu before you come in here, because they will skip right over you with no hesitation. Not only will they skip over you to the next person in line, they will keep skipping you and forget you even existed. The worker didn't use gloves so they handle the money, scratch their balls, pick their nose, and handle your food all at the same time.  Such a great multi tasker I must say, but at least he wore a Japanese little head band which kept him from sweating on the food. It was like the over the hill and over weight black karate kid flipping dogs.   In the end of it all...   the dog was just OK and the bun is about 3x to big for the weenie. That is unless you plan on stuffing it with endless amounts of toppings, which then it becomes not a hot dog imo.   Ill save you guys the trouble and...  "that's what she said"
4x5j_14-JTjZYrvl49D7Mw : This place is the worse Katsu in the city...and the Lobster dish, what a joke....seriously...it was so overcooked and dry.  The owner tried to tell me it was just made fresh, but  the employee told me that they make them in the morning and the refry to order....ughhh....Much like Freebird, these people thought that just because they opened on Figueroa, next to USC, that they could sell crap and succeed...Well, they're in for a surprise, As everyone knows, Freebird started out booming, cause all the students were willing to give them a try....but since they suck, they have almost no business at all now ....we would prefer to  just go the extra  block or so to Chipotle....All my friends at USC agree.....Soy Roll & Katsu super sucks....
lBigAsJO2-RYeK0tLn5cLQ : I love this place!  I'm from Texas, and have been looking for good Mexican food ever since I moved up here, and I've finally found it.  This place just opened and I hope it hangs in there, because without it I'll be left once again to have my heart broken on a regular basis ... by the terrible NY Mexican food.  Have the enchiladas ... excellent.
NzHelQaXOSo2VkcMydfHgA : The Cochinita Pibil is marinated and slow-cooked until it is wonderfully tender and full of flavor.  I get this every single time and will probably continue to do so.  The accompanying rice is nicely seasoned and fluffy, although I'm not a fan of the fried plantains.  The crab and shrimp empanadas are a nice diversion from the usual beef, pork, and chicken, and the guacamole is very fresh.  The service is very friendly and the sangria is great.  If you're a margarita person, they have pitchers of those, too.  The menu isn't very extensive but they do a good job on the dishes that are offered.  A nice place to grab some Mexican food and ritas.
aW4_Gs1G2vjF8573-HPOMQ : This place serves absolutely god-awful, heinous "food."  Working my way through the building from West to east:  Coffee: Horrible, old, burned, ucler-inducing.  Frozen Yogurt: Expensive, small portions, 75 cents for a topping? Kiss my ass.  Sandwich Station: Not too bad, depending on who you get to make your sandwich. Some of these people are 'tarded though and can manage to ruin an item that consists of bread, mayo, mustard, meat and cheese.  Burger/Chicken stand: Gross. Burgers are wafer thing and chicken sits under a heat lamp all day. Fries taste like matchsticks.  Mexican: Wrong, just wrong. Sometimes the beans are so dry they're like adobe bricks. The steak sits in a pool of grease all day and the chicken is dry and rubbery. Even the red sauce is wack... and it comes straight from a can!  Hot lunch station: Overcooked crap that has sat in a steam table for way too long. Sometimes the chicken is decent but everything else is gross and straight from a can.  Pizza: Horrible. Raw dough, gross sauce, nasty, cheap cheese.
PVhrfQMyqY6-d5rdngDuPw : I just read an enlightening review on Yelp: "They counsel their staff to keep their distance". This explains the extraordinary "tete de veau" that greets even the frequent customer. There is some weird concept here that equates aloofness with quality, when it's mere pretentiousness ("Whsk(e)y  Bar"). The attitude that friendliness is provincialism is particularly strange since their shops (excuse me, shoppes) in NoHo and Greenfield don't do this.
YiJHF2cB4jiiX5uVOqL0rg : WOAH woah woah! I had to sign up just to create a review after reading this pessimism. This weekend was the Rock's 1st weekend with a bar and a crowd (I know that because I bothered to ask, no assume). I'm not going to say my visit was impeccable, hence the missing star, but it is to be expected when you take into consideration the massive make over that has taken place.  I was with a party of 4. The service was slow but the drinks kept coming and our water was always filled. Once the food arrived it made us forgot how long we actually had to wait. It was perfection on a platter.   Must haves: tiger tear salad, summer rolls, and pretty much any entree as we all shared 4 different ones (traditional family style).   The waitstaff is friendly although they could brush up on the menu, there seems to be a disconnect, again, expected. The managers were attentive and constantly available, in fact I recall them addressing each individual table more than once just to check in and introduce themselves.  Takeaways: great atmosphere, charming staff and amazing authentic food. It was a little pricey and slow but once they start getting into the swing of things I'm sure the price will be fitting.   Good Luck FR and don't listen to these stick in the muds. Keep doing what you're doing and I will most definitely be back (with friends). Some people should stick to what they know, cupcakes and dumplings, neither of which is applicable here.
uNkNJcX_7J1NtIOUoii5mA : Ok. A 2 star rating is not so much that I hate this place, but its for a certain experience I had here. I think the food is decent, especially the "Rana Middle Eastern" menu. This is probably my favorite pizza of the myriad Lancaster Ave pizza places, and the Ed's sauce wings do taste good.  So let me explain the rating, and why I don't come here any more: the last time I ate the wings here, I got delivery. I broke into my food and began eating. I got to my 3rd or 4th wing and I looked at it. It looked a bit off, like something was amiss. I looked more closely, and fried into the wing was a fly. It has soured the restaurant for me.
jHvbnDRL6cHnZ5skkNDfYA : As a fan of Chipotle, I was quite mesmerized by the idea that there could be something better.  And I would say Chipotle has finally met a possible match, as both establisments acquire the same food culture and concept. However, there is definitely something about Chipotle that keeps me coming back, and that something Yelpers, is what Freebirds is lacking in.  Ingredients are interesting at first - four different kinds of tortilla you say? Spinach tortilla please! I was sold from the very start of the line, but that slowly diminished as they added more ingredients. The carne asada was a-OK, and not as fresh as you'd expect. Their sour cream is in some kind of toothpaste like device and they squirt out one line onto your burrito which is not enough to even taste it. I asked for more and they squirted out another small line. C'mon folks, I put more toothpaste on my toothbrush! Also, might I add that the first time I came here, I didn't even see the sour cream because it was in that stupid tube. Makes me wonder how fresh it is in the first place. Also, I'm very particular about my sour cream and like lots of it, but Freebirds' was a complete let down.  They sell "pot brownies" that could easily be mistaken for the brownies you can make with store bought mix. Sorry.  The long lines have since subsided so if you're willing to give it a shot and have the free time, then give it a try and don't let my review stop you.  Be warned of the parking if you're not a USC student and have the option of walking or biking here. Don't park in the structure. Try to look for metered parking first (they have a couple lined up right in front).  And if you do get let down, don't forget that Chano's is right across the way to relieve you of any post-traumatic Freebirds experience.
Bk0_p2y0uaJldWnNMnAuvw : Is this heaven? Everything about this place is good times. The combination of good food and service along with the rich history easily dismisses the cash only sign and cramped seating, which usually deters me. The long and narrow seating invites you to watch and smell all the delicious food getting prepared. This restaurant has personality that you can't build or buy. Parking and waits can be a struggle but is worth the annoyance. The food is spectacular. Cooked to order, this diner has some of the best breakfast and lunch around. The breakfasts hit the spot if that's your craving but even in the morning a burger usually calls my name. Their burgers remind me of In N' Out if you tried to make it yourself from scratch. Absolutely delicious! If you don't like beef they prepare some of the best turkey burgers around. I am not a big fan of  potato salad but here I have to order it. Their chili is not greasy and their fries are fresh and plentiful. The pies taste like ma baked it just for you. Iif you time it right you can get an Ollallieberry or Straberry pie when they are in season, add a scoop of real vanilla ice cream and space off into nirvana. The drinks are your usual pop, store bought juice, and diner coffee. The service is great and you are checked on to make sure everything is ok often. Overall this establishment is a pause in time and history adding to the richness Pasadena has to offer. I recommend stopping by and enjoying a quick pause to remember the good things life has to offer.
Ydp55pfFrTx0c4rRqVU9hQ : Went here for Valentine's dinner date this year.  My first impression when we made the reservations for RCS was: OK, this will be just an overpriced Outback Steakhouse. Anybody who's been to both places know that I was crazy for comparing the two! First off, when you drive up to RCS, it looks more like a small hotel than a restaurant. As I'm driving around the parking lot, I notice that there's a high volume of high end European cars parked here: your BMWs, Mercedes, Audi's, Porsche's, and Hummer's. That was my first clue about what I was about to experience. So after I park my lil Honda in between $200K of Euro muscle, we walk toward the front entrance, and we see a valet parker standing there. I'm thinking to myself, "Oh that's weird.. I don't remember Outback having a valet". The Valet guy greets us and opens the door for us. Already, the customer service is impressing me even before we step into the place.  They have a standard bar area/room, which looks like a nice hangout spot for sporting events/games. But for our romantic dinner, the hostess escorted us to a semi-private room. This place has about three or four of these rooms, I think.. (I didn't get a chance to walk around the whole restaurant). But anyways, these rooms have approx 6 tables each, so it gives a very intimate feel for the people eating in there. Instead of yelling over loud conversations around us, we were very happy to have a nice quiet delicious meal. Again, perfect for a romantic date.  When we entered our room, we saw the people who we would be eating with. I felt like I was in a room full of Ivy League scholars. Seriously, the guys in the room all were wearing either full suits or, at the very least, a blazer. It reminded me of Chris O'Donnell's preppy character in "Scent of a Woman". If you don't know what I'm talking about, shame on you. Scent of a Woman is a classic!! lol..   Back to RCS, the waiters were very nice and attentive, gave quick service. We had a Caesar salad and gumbo soup as our appetizers; they were good. For our main entrees, I ordered the ribeye, my lady ordered the filet. We couldn't be happier with our food. They put blue cheese and garlic on top of my ribeye.. awesome!! The meat was so tender and flavorful. Hands down, the best steak I've ever eaten! We also had creamed spinach and mashed potatoes as our side dishes. Everything flowed together like they were meant to be eaten together. Each bite was like a symphony orchestra playing Beethoven for my taste buds. lol.. Our desserts were "chocolate explosion" and crème brulee. We highly recommend the brulee. Now, I'm usually the type to avoid fancy, over-priced, over-hyped restaurants. RCS was fancy alright, but worth every dollar we spent that night. Overall, I wish Yelp had a rating of 6 stars, because I would easily pick 6 for this place!
oNi_rjRAIYpJBd5Q-11g5A : Fast service, decent prices and it's better for you than two slices at Round Table.  Although, I am a bit worried about the sound levels inside, it seems like OSHA should take an interest.  The only thing more piercing than 4-5 whirring blenders is the constant loop of Bobby Brown & Paula Abdul being played at 102 db.
kDiDiy_iyD9s6CFmLIj9cQ : Won ton soup for $1.65 lots of fat and salt in every dish nice people Patrons include homeless to emeriti avoid the overcooked*  *Special tip: for dishes with vegetables, only get the ones that still look green....duh
3pFXVqmOGzrggvOaQ6-T9g : My original review was fair and honest; just not entirely complimentary.  It was removed!!!  I guess they didn't like that I reported they had overdone (bordering on the burned) pancakes and the food was overpriced.  Buyers beware.
mu4vY_YEppk9BgNdQ9pOww : i love the taste ... i've been living in boston for a few years and i feel these are actually the best pizzas i've ever had.
KBo4zEDK8wm0UU1J7OcJQQ : E-Six is so incredibly fast and accommodating.  I agree with other reviewers on here, too---their staff is super friendly.      I typically use E-Six for developing medium format color/b&w negatives and chromes and just scan them myself, so I can't say anything about their printing or scanning services, but I can say that I've probably developed 30-40 rolls with them and they've never screwed one up.  They're in a great central location as well.  I feel really fortunate to have a consistent developer so close by, sending film through the mail gives me major anxiety.  There aren't alot of these places left.  Go E-Six, keeping it local!  Atlanta is lucky to have a place like this.
x7XMhDsNcKrQ3hgtGy0szg : Well here is an update. This place still sucks. I heard they were expanding to Phipps. BUYER BEWARE. So the jeans that I purchased with the store credit ripped. I called and emailed the store and they would not respond. I should post all the emails I sent on Yelp. That's sucky customer service. I finally had to call Visa and make them refund my money. Even though the store has a now refund policy. You know a store sucks really bad when your credit card refunds the money even when the store has a no refund policy.
vbgzn4ZQn0ggkhskv2Z6jQ : I have loved Hungry's since their old location in Memorial. Unfortunately the location on Rice blvd needs some help.   The every time I have been to Hungry's this last year, I have had problems with waiters forgetting about the table. Today's trip, my table had to ask for our appetizer about 20min after we ordered it. The "kitchen" got our order wrong and our drinks where never refilled.  I love the food at Hungry's, I just wish the wait staff will get their act together.
K8BuwaFkI5n-VNm-DoQMXg : I was super excited when Cold Stone opened a store right by USC several years ago.  I LOVE their Strawberry Shortcake Serenade (I don't think it's on the menu anymore, but it's amazing)!  It's made of sweet cream ice cream, strawberries, and yellow cake, all topped with whipped cream...  Yum...  =)  Unfortunately, they were out of whipped cream (WHAT?!?!) tonight, which was extremely disappointing because what good is strawberry shortcake anything without whipped cream?  The server was nice enough to offer a different topping instead, but there is no substitute for whipped cream, so I turned it down.  I was pretty disappointed, but still got the "Like It" size since I was already there.  4-stars for Cold Stone Creamery - their Strawberry Shortcake Serenade is AMAZING (especially with whipped cream!), but they lose 1 star because it's really overpriced ($4.99 for a "Like It" a.k.a. small size!  When did the price go up so much?).
EAvfVJx9uF6c1X2JBSXvjA : The problem I have with the Asgard is also one of the reasons I like it.  It's huge for a bar and that can go either way.   My first visit to the Asgard was a St. Pattys day a few years ago and I had so much fun. Me and my date showed up early to claim a table,  The best part was how many people were there. Being it was a drinking holiday it was packed, a couple hundred people easily. Everyone drunk and in a great mood.   I loved the Asgard for that day.   But alas the next time I went was a Monday night with a friend. We showed after work and we were the only people in there. They had most the lights off and the entire place just seemed lonely. When the place is empty it's borderline depressing, with so many unused seats you get the impression they were going out of business.   Food wise, nothing cutting edge but still really good.   The shepards pie is a favorite of mine.   The bar service is always great fast. I have nothing negative to say about them.   Lesson learned, never go on a slow night.
xbBOXe2Er54Rc9LBwr_bzw : I love Pepper's!  Tasty tasty tasty types of pizza.  Fresh topping, flavorful slices... and omg... the honey poppyseed dressing is to die for.  The house salad with the poppyseed dressing is AMAZING! It is my absolute favorite dressing in existence.  You need to go to pepper's more than once so you can try many many different slices.  If you don't eat pork, don't worry! Tons of pizzas without pork.  Vegetarian?  They have amazing choices for you too! White slices, red slices, pesto slices... feta, tomatoes, bbq, Tabasco! It's all there and it's all tasty :D
nCT9psTRQ6_axtP-fYoGFg : Once again, the chicken tikki masala is very delectable, and the garlic naan is the best. Don't get it to go, or your naan will get soggy, since it is served fresh and hot. Also, best chai in town! I've been here 3 more times, not getting tired of the same order. Rare for me. I mostly come here when it's either cold or rainy, and a cup of complimentary chai is just what I need. Who needs boba from the Asian Ghetto when you've got wonderful, fragrant, drool-inducing chai? Also, their lassi is good. Tastes like all-natural yogurt. I'll definitely be back!
8lZuK8rccKyS-hdcZ5bjQA : A very relaxing place to go.  It is like a secrete garden.
BajD0TTSzmspf8pbFEJMwQ : I wrote this paragraph long disclaimer but then realized it could be summarized with the short phrase: Mexican food in New England sucks.  However, even as as pseudo-mexican food it's still enjoyable..  and Filipe's does a solid burrito.  Once you know how to order, getting food here becomes painless, quick, and  consistently satisfying.  I've stuck to the burritos so far but a friend just recommended I try the quesadilla and ask them to put black beans on it for something a little more tasty.
ZG4GLs2PmN3d2vlH8oEWrw : eh....  the massive portions are really the only good thing about this spot. I take that back, the root beer floats are grand.  The prices are borderline outrageous though and the crave rating is very low.  Ritz Rating: 2/10 Crave Rating: 3/10
BdcsAOXi0p_N3iVA2Qi1KQ : I am very shocked at how low the rating was fire this place. I've been to many five guys restaurants and this one was just as good as the rest.
iQ_wA_5RaJTq1TpFgRvVog : I prefer Magus overall, but this place has a good selection of books and a friendly cat and is definitely worth a stop as long as you're not allergic. Could use better lighting in some aisles.
AiPtfaUaZgYPg1othti1Tw : I ate dinner here last night and was very pleasantly suprised by pretty much the whole meal.   After looking at the menu I wasn't sure what to think, since there was only 1 vegetarian dish, and I wasn't really sure what it was, so it was pretty much up to the restaurant to deliver, and it definitely did!   reasonable wine list, with the main entrees a little bit on the pricey side. Service was good though, and to boot they had iggys bread!!   Great Sazaracs as well...
qzBuiToe0UHBqunRpIwuTQ : Best bagels in the city but they often get my order wrong. It's also kind of expensive.
7nrWBMIU7ALwGg-ccJOLcA : Pretty close to being the best pizza I've ever had. Definitely the best in Atlanta.   Cool vibe too.  Bring your own wine, they have cups.  I think you can reserve tables if you call the day before... if you have more than 2 people and it's not a last-minute decision... I'd do that.
3Suiu_z-aZ4B6saIQpvAnQ : I love cupcakes.  I had been wanting to try this place ever since it opened, but even my love for cupcakes would not permit me to wait in a line for an hour.  So, patiently, I waiting, until yesterday when there was hardly a line at all!  My boyfriend and I waited MAYBE 10 minutes before we ordered.  We ended up getting chocolate marshmallow, vanilla milk chocolate, black and white, and coconut cupcakes.  I was expecting a lot.  I mean, people were waiting upwards of an hour for these thing!  They weren't bad.  The cakes for the most part were a little dry (except the chocolate cake on the black and white) but I loved all of the frostings (except the chocolate marshmallow...so not worth 3.50).  My favorite was probably a tie between black and white and the coconut.  The frostings are a tad on the sweet side, but what can I say, I like my cakes sweet.  It was worth a taste, and I'll probably go back to try some other flavors.  It's hard to resist a cupcake!
ga6zB8EJIx_AoNENfLzAcQ : Gushi may look like a shack, but their food never ceases to please the hungry and starving (financially) student. I've eaten here multiple times, and the service is always adequate, but not much more. Most people just pick up their food and take it to-go anyway, so it doesn't really matter. Just make sure to bring CASH, because that's all they will take!  My favorite thing to order is the Kalbi Plate ($10), which includes beef short-ribs drizzled with warm Korean barbecue sauce, green onions on top, and sticky white rice. They give you so much beef and rice, it's definitely worth the money. I've had the bulgogi before, but I always prefer my barbecue bone-in, it's so much juicier that way!  I've also had the Kimchi Tofu Soup, which was way too sour for my liking, so I wouldn't recommend it unless you want it painfully zesty.   The Chap Chae is also a good dish to get. It has thick glass noodles, beef, vegetables, and is mixed together with some sesame oil and soy sauce. It's a cooler dish and complements the barbecue quite nicely.  If you're taking the food to-go, ask for some extra barbecue sauce, because it truly is amazing. They're a little stingy with napkins and utensils, but they will begrudgingly give you more if you ask.  All in all, a great place with good Korean barbecue that will help you stretch your dollar and your waist size.
SkvYXxBxfi1Dgv9TtsUylA : Chanos gets 5 stars because it's Chanos.  Nachos? Yum.  Burritos? Yum.  Tacos? Yum. Cheap? Check. (Almost) Always Open? Check.  Crazy Drive-through with the window on the passenger side so you KNOW you should only be going with friends? Check.  I deplore individuals who hit up Del Taco instead of Chanos after a night on the Row or at the 9-0.  Seriously, why?  Side note: if you DO get nachos, leave the lid closed for a little so the cheese will fully melt.  It's all about delayed gratification.
_pWhkR2icaHVW1J8dRIR0w : This is not the best pizza I've ever had, but it's pretty good for what it is.  One pizza should be more than enough food for 2 people, so the portions are decent, although the pizza with a topping is about $20.  A bit pricey.  I would say this place and Mellow Mushroom are two of the best pizza places in Atlanta.  Styles are different for sure -- I prefer a more New York style, but this is probably close to what a true Italian slice of pizza is like.   However, with that said, it is still very different -- crust seems to be pretty thick, and there is not enough cheese.
7QAPqsPuuOMriskVtl2kuQ : Service was terrible, and the sushi was worse. The fish is just not fresh. Our waiter was very rude. I had the steak teriyaki, which was passable, but I won't be coming back any time soon.
vsZvyIuXtvwFXRpS7RnAwg : This place is pretty good and prices are pretty fair, service is a bit slow usually but not horrible. The main thing to go for is the happy hour, the appetizers are only 5 dollars, and are all pretty damn good. Get full for only 5 bucks + tax and tip :). However the downfall is that the service is even slower during happy hour, I guess it's because it's after 10 and the staff amount is decreased.
u7zCSjfRA1hIcuWkOdTXBQ : Only the best place for live music in Boston. Very intimate, and they get really good acts to come through ( and for never more than 10 bucks!).  I have never seen less than an amazing show at TTs
d25hjrbAergEIueioQF3cA : Browsed the shop once a few weeks back when I was looking for a new bike and got great service with the staff member that helped me taking 15-20 minutes of his time to walk me through options, discuss pricing and discuss the relative merits of steel vs carbon vs aluminum. He also showed me a recent custom touring bike the shop had built and generally came across as incredibly knowledgeable and friendly to deal with.  Ended up purchasing elsewhere, but brought the unassembled bike to the shop for assembly and an eventual fitting. Staff I dealt with at dropoff were very friendly and walked me through all the work they were going to do, pricing and how long it would take. Mitch later called me to report some minor damage to the frame that occurred during shipping and even emailed me pictures prior to them correcting the issue in case I needed to file a claim with the shipper.  One of the guys at the shop also made sure to point out that they were having a sale on some warm weather cycling clothing that wasn't otherwise noted with a sign. I ended up buying two jerseys at a great price because he made sure to let me know they were on sale.  So, all in all a great bike shop with incredibly friendly, helpful staff that go out of their way to provide information and guidance.
a9BNQuhPEm_vsjaaO8No5A : I think Dr Trebowski is retiring.  This review is about Dr. Hoghooghi.  I needed to have 4 impacted wisdom teeth removed.  Only one of which had even broke the surface.  I was told I would need a week of recovery time, and I would need general anesthesia for the surgery.  He also talked about all the various things which could go wrong (at my request), and what he would do in response to each of them.  From talking to other people, I'd heard a range of experiences (ranging from horrible to great) about wisdom teeth removal.  My surgery sounded more invasive than most people I'd talked to, so I was pretty nervous.  I had the teeth removed yesterday, and I'm still doing great.  I woke up after the surgery in a bed and felt perfectly comfortable.  I started making phone calls home to tell family I was ok.  The nurse quickly took my phone and told me not to talk, so I didn't break the stitches.  After I took the gauze out of my mouth a few hours later, nobody could tell that I had surgery.  I felt perfectly normal on the vicodin, and even without the vicodin the pain is comparable to the soreness left over after having been punched in the jaw (not too hard).
-E1q4SZQBk0k7SYBhoDqUg : When in doubt, you can't go wrong at a Peets.
WOYDcZgAc5UgDIxVc-kKzA : A staple for a socialite in Midtown.  I dont care who you are, its a reliable dinner and brunch option.  Its hard to find both in the same place.  I love the dinners at all Marlow's locations (been to 3) but love this one now ever since I moved ITP.  They have a solid menu and strong drinks if you know how to ask.  The atmosphere is homely and comfortable but not so much you feel like your having a regular joe night out.  Its as unpretentious as homely can get I guess is the best way to put it.  The nights are solid and great but the brunch is not one to miss.  My friends and I were loyal every sunday for many months.  The buffet is top notch.  A great mix of breakfast and lunch that can be so hard for some "claimed" brunch establishments but here it all flowed with little effort it would seem.  over all the food is great if not superb.  The scene is hot and the people are too.  Its a great way to start the evening or cure a hangover sunday morning.  Check it out and get the brunch, if it peaks your interest come back for dinner.  Im sure it will please
AltXHgsEYQqS4r-chjlF3Q : Their garlic fries are overly garlic-y and I feel like I'm eating fries WITH my garlic... ermmm no thanks. I do like the chili cheese fries and the normal burger but it's a little bland for my tastes. Good prices and all. Restaurant could be maintained better but it's Berkeley so can't expect too much.  I'm not a big fan of corn (like everyone else and their mom) so I can't say that I love their corn chowder or corn bread although it is okay. I usually give my corn bread to whoever I'm with... However, if you love corn...come here!
er5bQERQt6iKs-DTw4cHxQ : This place is pretty shabby compared to the newer karaoke joint, enKore, across the street above Earl's.  I've been here twice and it's always been with my Taiwanese friends who miss singing back in Taiwan. It's definitely a very Asian hobby. The songs are fairly new though so I give them props for that.  But the interior is definitely quite shady and it always looks like it's closed from the outside, what's up with that? Gated door and everything? I think they charge a lot for drinks too and maybe even for the singing rates. I'm not really a fan.
oVQwUuzLEGrfp_uszUSNog : Not a bad Thai restaurant.  The place was kind of dirty.  Food was good.
dllECz-lQjZqr9NCrGRDVw : This place was good.  The menu was varied and eclectic: asian stir-fry with kimchi, mushroom pasta with a cream sauce, chicken tacos appetizers, bouillabaisse, fancy salads, flat breads, etc. Maybe it meant something for everyone, but it was bit confusing trying to decide between such varied options.  I went with the stir-fry with shrimp, not too risky but I love me some good kimchi! The stir fry was good, with vegetables I would expect, but the sauce tasted a little bland/bottled and the add-on shrimp was only three on a skewer. The atmosphere was cool, spacious, modern, with plenty of booths and lots of room for bigger parties.  The serve knew here stuff and managed the ten of us ladies pretty well.  Best part of the meal: cheesecake lollipops incuding one order on the house! All in all, it was a good place for a night out with a group, but not a place to go for amazing food.
0f_8X9EjjsFQCKuR68UwGQ : I truly LOVE this place.... I will always be thankful to my friends that worked at UCLA Medical Center for introducing me to this place. I wish I knew of it sooner. Nevertheless, every time I'm within earshot of Westwood village, I have to pick up some cookies for myself, friends & co-workers. The most cookies I ever bought here was 14 dozen. YUP. Fourteen... Don't be mad. I waited my turn in line. The woman behind me at the time ordered 40 dozen, so I didn't feel so bad for holding everybody up.... Service is quick. Staff is friendly. Know what you want cause if you're there around opening time (noon on weekends) there may be a line.  My favorite is the oatmeal raisin. Yes, please. ALL DAY... This is usually the cookie i pick to make the ice cream sandwiches. Both sides, I'm a purist.   Being a native San Franciscan and knowing what an IT"S IT is,  ice cream sandwiches are my specialty. Diddy Riese allows you to make any ice cream cookie sandwich combination you can think of.  It's very inexpensive. It's $1.50 now... I remember when it was just .75 cents.  At $1.50, it's such a deal. You get to pick from 10 different cookie flavors (in any combination) and combine it with a nice scoop of Dreyer's ice cream of your choice. Perfect dessert after eating somewhere in Westwood like Sak's....Or you can get a lunch special there. Diddy dog & drink for 2 bucks. Unreal.... Go there & see what the hype is all about. Hope that you're not behind me in line cause I'm ordering DOZENS....
FZx6CqsG0LBi80D3t9SuUg : food = 3.5 starts, pretty good but pricey (I prefer their sister restaurant, DALI and TAPEO)  service: see review below  I use to frequent this place but now I will try to find other alternatives I had a company party here last Thursday and I was very disappointed in them.  I had a spreadsheet with all the details for them to follow and they did not do anything I requested.   The servers were very nice but the owner could have been more attentive to details and more accomodating.    Overall, the company party ended up ok.  However, the owner (after making the money) started being extremely rude to people who stayed after the party.  These people paid for their own drinks!  Not cool and I will convince my company not to do business with them anymore.
IxflkUqBTuB5J9cM51ph7A : Sick of curry-scented Central Sq? Me, too. Thank god for Brookline Lunch, the miniature breakfast mecca off Mass Ave.  My roommates and I love this place. Where else can you get a mammoth omelette for $4? You can't even buy eggs that cheap. The hash brown potatoes here are to die for. They're neither hashed nor brown, and they're barely potatoes. The cook makes them chock full of colorful vegetables, and I don't think it's ever the same melange twice. My most recent serving included spinach, carrots, asparagus, onions, broccoli, mushrooms, and what may or may not have been Brussel sprouts. They're pretty much the best thing since sliced ... potatoes.  Also, the pancakes are above-average, the French toast is quite tasty but unremarkable, and I'm told they always do their meat right. As for lunch and dinner foods, well, I've never had them but I'm sure they do a fine job of it, too. But seriously. Just get breakfast.  Service is spotty, natch. The waitress/owner is the hardest working woman in the restaurant business and usually does it alone. So it's not the fastest service in the world, but that's fine. Linger over your eggs and a good cup of coffee, and watch the skinny hipsters gather around Middle East across the street. Revel in your full tummy of delicious food. Curl up in the fetal position. Love life, for your bill will never be above $10.
7BbopK-Gv3FglAsyQ3Dxtw : I went here yesterday and ordered what the cashier told me was the most popular bahn-mi, the chargrilled pork. The meat was tasty, however it left me wanting more and the veggies were nice and fresh. The meat:veggie ratio was a little off kilter. Could have used more meat and less veggies. The bread was fresh and toasted, yet soft.   The service was quick and the price was right for an on-the-go snack. The restaurant is tiny and the instrumental music is a little too loud, but that's not to say I won't be back again.
VHBwPkPu2O29qd-gSjvFkQ : I LOVE this place.  The crust is light and tasty, and the gourmet pizza selection is great.  The buffalo chicken pizza is best, imo.  A couple more reasons to order from Beauty's:  online ordering system! (gets me every time); super quick delivery; really nice employees. AND a "loyalty discount."  The more you order, they increase the percentage that they take off your total.  I think there's a cap of 3 or 5%, not sure.  But it's kind of like a perpetual, automatic coupon.  It makes me feel loved... by my pizza place :)
0pgovNQTCo3Et5gYxxBK0g : Cupcakes! I love cupcakes. And there are people who don't like cupcakes? Such crazy talk! They're little cakes in small cup sizes! Perfect if you don't want to gobble up an entire sheet of cake by yourself!   I like coming here since one of my friends works here and got me addicted to the cupcakes! I adore the little mini cupcakes since I don't really want to eat the ENTIRE thing by myself when I have 93874018437 million weddings to go to. But the tiny ones are a treat and it tastes really fresh and amazing! And they are made with local products and as organic as possible which makes it even better since I firmly believe in supporting our local products.   I got a few for my sister and she loved them. She's a big fan and be sure that I'll be getting some mini ones for her birthday on four-twenty!
5N2eJlZCuuj1ZKdSkqcrLw : I almost feel like it's a sin to give Tosci's 2 stars, but alas, I must...  For $3.75, you, too, can get an undersized ice cream that won't fill you.  I got the cocoa pudding (not bad).  Breaking the bank at $5.75, you can get yourself a frappe and mix in goodies like pistacchio (if they have them...).  It just might cost you an arm and a leg to get frozen delectables here.  While you are lamenting the loss of appendages, you can sit with your computer in the tiny, but trying-to-be-chic interior.  Just don't venture to the bathroom...it's a scary, scary place...
C7yTvYclnXuCaEJURNs8mw : Judging the quality of this restaurant's food, it deserves two stars. I ordered a falafel plate, and a beef shawarma plate. THe falafel plate was better in taste as it had more flavor than the beef shawarma. Simply put, this place tries to be authentic middle eastern/Mediterranean food, but its falls way short. It was really obvious to me that the hummus they serve is not freshly prepared because it tastes like they use the premade hummus you can find at a middle eastern market. I'm middle eastern, and when I eat at middle eastern restaurants, I know the owner is not trying hard to serve authentic middle eastern food when you serve your customers canned hummus. The garlic sauce receives the same criticism because it tasted premade. It really shows the true colors of a middle eastern restaurant when they're hummus and garlic sauce are lacking in flavor and quality. The beef shawarma was under-salted and under-flavored. I expect more out of a restaurant purporting to serve my culture's food. On the plus side, the prices are fair, but maybe they are fair because the owner is saving money by using canned hummus and canned garlic sauce and not using any quality ingredients/spices in their foods.
4-aTc79DEyQWo89olHCIZw : Today was my first time coming here and I really liked it. The place was clean, the workers were very kind and the fact that they serve Starbucks coffee is pretty cool as well. I got a Caramel Frappucino which was so much better than anything I have had from Starbucks and also a croissant which was very fresh and delicious. They also have a section of prepared foods, snacks and lots of beverages. Located near Leavey library and the freshmen dorms, its a great, reasonable place to go to for a snack.
b3FNxzJzv-Ot5fe2Iarhsg : Short Stop Deli delivers. Great sandwiches, a wide selection and bread baked on sight. This places never closes 24/7/365 and they love to supply athletic teams that are visiting the area. Good, fresh and user friendly, a great deal for good deli delights. Rock-on Short Stop!
LcINWu6mmk966p40HfjuBQ : I am a pretty harsh judge of pizza...but wow, I loved the pizza here.  My friend and I ordered a greek pizza with feta cheese, olives, and amazing tomatoes and mushrooms...it was great.  The servers seated us immediately and took our order since we were in a rush to get to another event....  The pizza was great.. crust was good, not greasy, and the flavors meshed well togeter.  Bravo! I will be returning.
6eILrjIMfZEmQ2HVg4-gjw : i didn't realize that i was actually living it blingy style, until i saw this place on E! as I was eating there...try the fish, it's REALLY good.  And everything else, you can't go wrong here.  Although dishes can be a bit overpriced, but if you're staying at the W, you're blinged out anyway.
7XrWJhkz5p6V2LJnwnwjdA : We took your advice the other day to try it out before a movie in Pasadena. And although we weren't greeted by a ceremonial banging of the drums, we were ushered in by a "Spicy Tuna Bomb," which is a huge dollop of spicy tuna perched upon a crispy shiso leaf which has been tempura'd. Pure genius. In all of my visits to Japan, various Nobus, strip mall sushi, New York sushi have I had such a thing. It's strictly unorthodox, but who cares?  The menu is rife with these kinds of fusion offerings, and small, izakaya, or "Japanese tapas" dishes. The sushi itself was good, perhaps not amazing, but sometimes you're in the mood for age dashi tofu, or hamachi kama or whole squid. Anyway, must say, we'll be back at Matsuri.
Ap0qrrAsFeGSzEmGRR1SPg : i like their fish taco deal on mondays. the fish is breaded nicely and is always crispy. a bit too much cabbage for my taste but it's ok, i can always ask for less or take it off myself. the rest of the food is good, but nothing too special.
FS7PG3zzG-IXAzbmecj6Zg : If you order a soda they will bring you a one-liter glass. At least that's what it feels like. The food is not so hot (not so appealing, not so heated, and not so spicy) and the lines are usually long... but given the fact that the Mexican food options are limited in the Square, it's not a bad choice.
68WFjMiHFYGBPTbP9paERw : This is not the place to go if you are looking for "authentic" sushi.  This is the place to go if you are hungry and you'd like to eat a ton of rice and fish and walk out full and happy.  It's best described as a neighborhood sushi joint where the owners clearly love feeding people, as well as joking around with them.  The cuisine may be Japanese, but the warmth of the place comes from the owners' Filipino roots.  I go here when I'm feeling blue and Andrew and Arthur never fail to fill my plate and make me laugh.  Half the fun is watching new people come in and try to figure out what on earth is going on in the chaos.  It's good to be a regular.  (And if you're a regular, a lot of great stuff appears on your plate that isn't on the menu!)
McWC4w0sxThHlszT3yU73g : Lulu's is not an Asian place. Lulu is a noodles place. Do not expect your noodles to be flavored or tasty, just expect noodles. And don't you dare complain that the vegetarian noodles came with meat. They will not believe you even though you have a piece of questionable matter in your plate.
b4XYMkG8q1u1AYFojmmGgw : Parking isn't great but it is next to USC so the students are everywhere! Food was good! I had the Chicken Fettuccine. It was a bit too much food for me but now days everyone tries to give you way too much food! I liked the set up of the place.. the way you order and so forth! Seating was okay. I enjoyed my food and would definitely go back! ;0)
6D0m5A_sg8s7bKD06s71Iw : For the wait and price you can definatly get a better burger elsewhere.  Sweet potato fries and shakes are awesome... but with a place called a burger palace... don't you want an awesome burger?  The staff always seemed friendly on the three visits I've made to the palace.... but yeah I wasn't sure about the tipping, I'm assuming most people don't but I left a couple bucks.  all in all I've been here because it's a couple blocks from my house, if i lived elsewhere I'd probably not return
vYxRIb5LnpgmJ4Q2kywN1Q : I needed to buy new glasses and was considering going to Lenscrafters or Eyemasters.  Then I came on yelp and read all the reviews for Eclectic Eyewear.  I am very pleased that I did.  I walked in yesterday after realizing it was right on the Drag (I am a graduate student at UT).  Martin greeted me very nicely and I told him I needed new glasses.  We sat down and he told me all the benefits I get with my insurance (Superior Vision), which are amazing.  I asked about lenses and he explained all the options.  I knew I was interested in AR coating and he told me about those options, as well.  He handed me a tray and said I could pick frames and they would hold them for me once I came in with my prescription.  I was there about 30 minutes.    I went in today and purchased a pair that he had picked out considering the styles I was looking at.  I liked the pair but not the color.  At the time I didn't know it came in the other color. He went over all the options, again.  I expected to spend about 200-300 on my glasses.  I spent 199.20. As I was leaving the store I saw a pair of glasses that I liked.  I called about 10 minutes later and asked him to hold that pair and that I might switch them out.  I returned in a couple of hours.  He was out to lunch but another associate helped me and found that the same pair I had purchased were available in the color I wanted.  It actually was in the tray of glasses we looked at. Hehe! So we just switched them out.    I am very happy with my experience at Eclectic.  The people there are really nice and knowledgeable.  I am very selective with major purchases, which as a grad student means anything over $50.  This is definitely the place to go.  Although I wanted to get glasses quickly, I realize that those other types of places are poorer quality for sometimes much more money.  I am glad I found Eclectic and I know it will be worth the wait.
GiVbhdCwJC_rN-SxvqjVGw : My first time Chipotle was sometime last year. It was one of the best things, and I fell in love with Chipotle. The service is fast and the food is great. I love their chicken tacos and burrito bowls and they have tons of other great choices. If you love Mexican food, I would definitely suggest trying  it out!!
WbOtOWODq3K2InfDfc5FpQ : My husband and I went here on Valentine's Day and they had a 6 course Prix Fixe menu which included Butternut Squash Soup, Slow Braised Short Ribs and a Heart Shaped Red Velvet Cake for dessert. Everything was delicious.  The wait staff and chef made the evening extra special.  The bill can get to be pricey, but would definitely go back with a restaurant.com coupon or on special occasions..
vh95ntX8LbM6QwAChOgg_A : Come here, grab a coffee, and plan an intifada or discuss which tree on campus is the best one to take up residence in.
CjtLsMdRxWVx-HvyBjUB5g : As a big fan of BBQ I frequent this place regularly. There burgers are quite possibly the best I have ever had. Nothing too complex, but not just a plain old burger like you get from other restaurants. Their fries, when fresh, are thick-cut and tossed with a tasty seasoning. I recommend dipping them in one of their house-made bbq sauces as opposed to traditional ketchup. They also offer the option of corn bread, which is a different option for an establishment in California.  Their food had a great smokey taste due to their large smoker, "Big Momma". My personal favorites are the bacon cheddar burger which comes with thick smokey bacon and onion rings on the burger and the cabo avo burger which has a green chili, pepperjack cheese, and guacamole.   The prices are very reasonable and after around 50 meals here I have never had a bad experience. Unfortunately they are currently undergoing an ownership change but are rumored to be keeping a similar style of menu. Check them out!!!
NH5SMY6argdlQ5a-lelCAA : Only god knows how much money I've dumped on this place. I was first introduced to froyo here and have loved it since.   I def. prefer the original over the blueberry flavor though.
C0j1ayVhiiLM8-U8q94S1A : Second visit here and I think A-OK sums it up. The food was good and we will definitely be back, but a bit of an attitudinal  (is that a word?!) waiter and slow service tainted the experience somewhat.   We had a bit of a wait to even be noticed at the door, despite that the host was actually cleaning tables when we had clearly been standing for a good 5 minutes.  After we ordered our food, we got our drinks. I ordered a fountain diet coke and what I got was really really sweet and syrupy - not like diet at all. I know fountain drinks taste different, but I drink fountain all the time at work and elsewhere and i am a coke expert Anyway - i just asked the server if he was sure it was diet - I really hate regular as i feel it sticks to my teeth - and all i got was a really grumpy and antagonistic response, like I had just insulted him and had been unreasonable in my request! He then said he would bring me another if i wanted but he turned away to another table, giving me no chance to respond. 5 minutes later another comes, but it's a can, which he opens at the table with a flourish so I "believe he is not lying" !!! WHAT?!!!!! This was all done with no hint of a smile and made me feel really stupid and a pain in the ass for daring to ask him to do his job!!  Food came and was good - sweet potato fries were yummy and portions were plentiful. Hub's homemade wholewheat bread was gorgeous!  We had to wait for ages to catch the eye of our server for the check - I am convinced he was blantantly ignoring us as I am sure eye contact was made. It seemed like he was just deliberately trying not to engage with us.  To sum up- food was pretty solid, service pretty scrappy but I would go back for a good feast. A-OK for now!
gS0R09nRR37gb9bfyAuZWw : I don't know why I'm in love with this place so much... I think its a cross between the fact that I'm really comfortable sitting by the window doing some people watching while drinking my French pressed coffee out of a real mug that I can refill as many times as my heart desires.... and the fact that every time I go there, I have a really nice encounter with either a friend, stranger, or employee. Everyone is just so friendly and the whole atmosphere is warm.  Greyhouse has great coffee that gets the job done. The only con I see is that if you just simply want one small cup of coffee you're spending about three dollars when you can get a big one from Starbucks for less than 2. Quality not quantity but sometimes it gets pricey for an average college student to go to regularly...I've been trying to cutback on my obsession and only going if I'm planning on working for hours straight and need their bottomless mug to keep me going.  Loving on the iced creme brulee lattes in the Spring.
Q_HV0x8aoY7HLk9G8jP41A : Been going to PnB for many years.  I just had lunch there with a friend today and as usual, was not disappointed. The cheesburgers are fresh and moist, their secret sauce is perfect and fries are always hot and tasty with portions big enough to share. Breakfasts are great too, but I especially love their pie...it's enough to write home about.  The coconut, banana cream, peach (summer only), apple pies and strawberry cake are our favorites.  Made fresh daily, the crust is flaky and buttery and everything is not oversweetened.  Definitely leave room for pie though.  If you can, have a milkshake - they are made from real ice cream and bound to hit the spot.   It's cash only and there is limited parking in the back so just park on the street.   Enjoy!
iTAUnOTBXIh_ftVJbd6cPA : A UCLA and USC student favorite, this place is definitely one of my favorites. Trust me, it's not because this place has the best cookies or the best ice cream or anything like that. It's because this place is C-H-E-A-P.   If you're one of those people that gets easily confused at new locations, let me save you some time. Get an ice cream sandwich, straight and simple. Well, not quite. You get a choice of ice cream flavor, and a choice of cookies. And don't feel too obligated to have both sides of the ice cream cookie sandwich to match, get a little creative and mix it up. Me? I'm a little funky and I heart chocolates of all kinds so I got vanilla ice cream sandwiched between chocolate chip and white chocolate macadamia. You won't be disappointed here. FYI, feel free to get a spoon to help you along with eating the monstrous cookie sandwich.  Don't even bother bringing the big bucks to this location. Feel perfectly free to walk out here in your sweats carrying a few bucks along. Those few bucks will take you far, as an ice cream cookie sandwich cost less than $2 =)  And if you're not feeling cookie-like, they have brownies, they have drinks, they have other sweets that'll keep you relatively satisfied. But come on, why come here if you want something OTHER than ice cream cookie sandwiches???
TY09J7Y8e-Z4Mq7u7up9Zg : Well, lets see. Its the perfect idea, well executed.  Step 1: Pick a cookie. Step 2: Pick an ice cream. Step 3: Pick another cookie. Step 4: Put em all together and give up $1.50.  Really, that's all the review anybody needs. It could be store bought cookies with bulk ice cream and it'd still be delicious. Instead they make the cookies there and use Dreyers.   If you don't like cookies or ice cream, stay away. However, If you have a soul you'll probably like it.
j7yp_NBLvEwbECC3EYk1fg : Before the advent of YogurtBerry and PinkMango and whatever combination of tart yogurt and fruit name you can think of, that have been surfacing in the past year or so - this place was THE place for fro-yo.  I used to marvel at the lines that form out the door, the Audi's and police cars that would illegally park in that strip of red curb just outside the store, and the people who would walk out of there with half-gallon sized cups of overflowing frozen yogurt, and say, "How could it be that good?"  Then I tried my first (I think it was peach) and I was hooked. It doesn't matter what flavor you get, they all are SO TASTY. Not that they necessarily taste like their purported flavor. But whatever it is, it tastes dang good. My friends and I used to joke that it must be laced with some "other substances," because I would literally get these cravings for the mysterious Yogurt Park flavor.  They change up the flavor mixes pretty regularly, so you can try a bunch. And they have your standard candy mix-ins - though gummy bear is my favorite (they get all hard and super chewy in the cold yogurt, I love it). They also are willing to give you half-half of 2 flavors, great way to try out the different flav's. And while the monster bucket of yogurt is an option, usually the mini is enough sugar for me, and that size is pretty cheap.  Sure, there's Yogurtland and other places now. But I think Yogurt Park still has a space in my dessert stomach, and on top of that, it's a Berkeley icon that will probably be around forever. Go Yogurt Park.
XjpnuSmeHm2o6HecnYCfAw : Found my first bone today in my Vine sushi...   As I mentioned in my earlier review, this place is only good if you go to Columbia Uni. and want half-decent sushi that's close by.  But how hard is it to de-bone the fish before you serve me the sushi?  (But what's really sad is that I will probably keep coming back due to the proximity)
8_U8XouNQz4UMXVOV0olJg : THIS IS AN OUTRAGE!!!   You have really put me right in it!! Yes You!!  My integrity has been impugned  because of your wanked on taste buds!!! Cheap !!! I got right grafted for 11 bux for the worst meal I have had in some time now!!!  on top of that my colleague had to starve for the fact it took an hour to prepare ... really an hour !!!! I could make better food our of a trash bin really no joke !! Im that good. it you read this take my advice these other reviews are written by people who hate them selves they sit alone and bite there pillow in bitter cold of night.. Pillow biters I call them. if you want some good thai just do rambutann or that cheap spot across from rambutan. This place was the flu we paid 50 Dolla for Crap!!!  THIS IS AN OUTRAGE!!!   yOU REALLY HAVE ME OUTRAGED!!!
f8L7RG5NPvtrJgYIVmlKkg : I can summarize my entire review in four words:  Eight Dollar Lunch Buffet.  Monday-Friday.  The selection is relatively small (maybe 5 or 6 entrees to choose from, as well as rice, naan and a selection of chutneys) but it's just enough that you can try everything and WILL want to return for more.  There's a good variety of flavor levels, as well as vegetarian and meat options.  I've gotten take out once in the evening and it was awesome.  I can't wait to go back and would recommend this place to anybody.
WJ-n7wJLKb-sZJn1djvb2g : I originally wrote a review that was a tad on the negative side when they first opened. I wasn't a big fan when it opened. I've since been back several times and enjoy Bocado a lot. The menu changes often, although I keep coming back to the burger. The H&F bread sampler is always a good place to start. It's a great neighborhood spot and an anchor on the Westside
XiSnZsYYkA18Uja4sAz1AQ : Good ol' "Buck-Fiddy".  The underground name--but the only accepted Westwood vernacular--is an homage to the days when a hoagie-style sammitch cost $1.50.    It never fails.   A bit too much bread--let's be honest.  And they'll give you xtra veggies, so you normally end up w/ a salad on bread.  But their Italian sausage sandwich is sweet.   Again, drunk food.
13CUKM6pLM2KOBT-m14Xig : Deliverance from the vilest hangovers...now in truck form!  Seriously, as attested everywhere in recent Philly history by college students, Bui's is your miracle cure for your nightime indiscretions.  No matter what the issue is, bacon, egg and cheese with "salpeppaketcha" on a perfect pillowy white bun will help you regain your footing on the path to tranquility.  Take that first bite, bask in the sunshine and smile: bliss  PARTING THOUGHT: Bui's staff is great about making unusual sandwiches.  For example, I'm a fan of the cheesesteak with egg and siracha!
m2xjYvxVL36XrQ0jCUpU-A : Gushi has to be THE best place to go pig out as a college student. You seriously get what you paid for and the portions are downright enormous.  No other place compares in westwood.  Get the Kalbi bowl. Its delicious smothered with their awesome teriyaki sauce and sriracha.  Outside seating is a little ghetto and limited, but the food makes up for it.   Also, try walking to Gushi so you would't feel bad for inhaling 3 day's worth of food in one sitting.
lxHg_iS_gqL3I8fAU1tPDA : Superlative defines this little sandwich store.   There's so much to write because it was that damn good. And +.. ah those free homemade pickles.  I fully suggest going online and reading the menu prior to coming for two reasons: the menu is huge and its just a fun read (with sandwiches named frigid bitch and juggs, cmon now).   The owner is super nice and can be seen often helping out staff. The atmosphere and the decorating is something that you would experience in the village in NYC or in San Fran. Love it! Plus its just down the hill from Prospect Park which has a great view of the city of Prov.  This is a fun place with great palate pairings and huge assortment of tastes for everyone. C'mon take your mouth for a roller coaster ride.  Go on a Tuesday and its 2 for 1. now that's wicked good.
DYSoR-85E_1pMDVqMx-nSA : I've been ordering from Cinderella's for ...8 or 9 years.  The service and food quality has steadily declined in that time period. It had gotten to the point where I would pre-heat my oven to finish cooking the pizza when it arrived.  And then tonight, I ordered a pizza, then sat down at my computer to do some work. The doorbell rang, and I sprang from my seat to run down the 2 fights of stairs to collect, presumably, my delivery food. But there was no one at the door. Confused, I went back upstairs and saw that I had 2 missed calls on my phone, both from Cinderella's. I had a voicemail saying that my pizza delivery was downstairs.  If your primary delivery notification is to be via cell phone, you need to tell your customers that. I have been ordering from you for nearly a decade, and have never NOT had the delivery person ring the doorbell as the primary form of notification.  Add to that the undercooked pizza dough factor, and I am officially done with Cinderella's.  BTW, it's really not my style to bad-yelp a business, but this was really quite ridiculous.   Sorry Cindy, but I have to break up with you. Hope you find a better life with someone else.  XO
gsroaRklIBlaWMLcGXRi_Q : Yay for having Shamrock Shakes!! Yay for being in a convenient location!! Yay for being 24/7!!  What else? It's McDonald's. You can't be that picky guys.
RtCluD4OWCyFoVtEwEdXDA : I was so excited to try this restaurant, because I was so disappointed with any of the other Thai food in the Princeton vicinity, and I LOVE Thai food. And sure enough, I was pleasantly surprised at how yummy their dishes were. I really enjoy their yellow curry, phad Thai, Phad Se yew, Tom Yum Goong, Chicken satay, and although not on the menu... they still have it if you ask... Tod Mun (fish cakes). And of course you have to order their Thai ice tea or coffee. For dessert, I have tried almost everything, and their sticky rice may sound odd to some of you, but it is really delightful. One thing that I have to say is that their portions seem to be just right for me... so if you are looking for leftovers, you probably won't have any, which is great for your lunchers who are coming from work and don't have to feel guilted into bringing garlicky/stinky leftovers back with you to work. Anyhow, you really should try it. Also, I have a baby and they are always really sweet to her when we come in and don't mind the little napkin piles we accidentally leave behind...oops.
qPcaYGDgstWq6HyBquVubg : This salon is beautiful inside. My appointment was on time and the stylist was friendly. If you want more of a professional you are going to have to pay more. The only thing that is difficult is the parking is horrible. I haven't been back because I started going to Toni and Guy In Cranston.
rQDBYHx1r1NB3JXiNML5tQ : My wife and I went to White Dog Cafe last night for dinner before a business mixer.  Some people commented about the menu differences between the website and restaurant.  It appears that dining menu changes quite often, but the bar menu doesn't.  They will give you a bar menu if you ask, but the wait staff doesn't like it (less gratuity).  The food is good and there are some constant themes in what they serve.  They are a fan of their special organic greens.  It appeared to be a mix of fresh chives, parsley, and roasted peppers.  This found its way into our tomato bisque, on top of our mac & cheese, and on top of the salmon.  My wife really liked it and put on the fresh diner rolls as well (you are served about 1.5 per person).  For beverages we had hot mulled cider.  Really good and the only organic non-alcoholic beverage.  Another party was disappointed that they the only other choices were water and coke products.  "No Ginger Beer, and this place calls themselves organic?"  On the plus side, if you are vegetarian and the current special has meat they will provide a vegetarian version for you and most other on-menu choices as well.  Pasta and tofu seem to be the primary substitutes.  All-in-all a pleasant experience, but maybe a bit overpriced for what you are getting.
5IrLM-tfHjupTe5vWAQBZw : I'm really rating this @ 3.5 stars. I'm a fan of Peruvian food, I eat it and make at least twice a month. With that said. I enjoyed the meal my fiance and I had but the portions were a little smaller than what I'm used to compared to Natalies, Los Balcones b4 the makeover or Marios. A little pricey given its in a mercado. The ceviche was good could have been traditionally made insead of the So. Cal twist with the seaweed salad. Its should have been running with leche de tigre not just coated and again the portion should have been bigger given I paid 12$ for it. The oxtail was delicious with barley risotto well made al dente and creamy. The aji de gallina was good but could have been spicier. Also we had to ask twice for our drink. I would return but after my other options are exhausted.
yVA0qJgOG11Ml2tzrg_awg : You have to be a detective to find this place.  Friendly owners, EXCELLENT and interesting selection of wines to try, nicely decorated (you can tell they dropped some serious coin decorating the place). Unfortunately the lounge is located in a hidden corner of a mall complex, making it sort of a lousy location. We went there on a Thursday night, and were almost the only people there. I like a quiet bar though, so I did not mind...but it made me worry for their business.  It was on the expensive side I feel. One ounce squirts of wine seemed to range from $2.00 to $7.50. This adds up VERY quickly. I ordered a duck charcuterie platter ($17) that was excellent. The duck prosciutto is a must have, as it is hard to find anyway, and better than regular prosciutto.  One thing I really find lame is the "corkage" places charge to open one of their own damn bottles...especially a $15 corkage. It is just off putting. Not everyone does this...and they do not HAVE to. It is just a greedy choice. I sort of understand a restaurant doing this, but a bar? C'mon...  I went here to experience the Enomatic wine squirting machines...which I found sterile and unappealing. But they do allow one to very conveniently sample all kinds of wine in small amounts, which I liked. I suppose there are always trade-offs.  I liked the large projecton on the wall; a nice classy yet entertaining alternative to the usual abhorrent plasma screen showing distracting imagery of a sports team I don't care about.  I'd go back...it was way more attractive and interesting than that Bodega place.
voCLQko16hofGRfDCr1zpA : i want to like this place because they seem like nice people but i was really annoyed with the (lack of) service i experienced recently. brought two pairs of boots needing simple repair.  was told to come back on day X.  came back on day X.  couldn't find the guy that made the order or my shoes.  finally after about 20min of rummaging they called him on the cell phone.  shoes aren't ready, was asked come back on day Y. i came back a few days AFTER day Y. two kids are sitting there looking at me like i'm crazy. finally one girl, who was eating chinese food with her fingers, gets up to help me.  takes her chinese-y food fingers and greases up a bunch of other shoes in a listless attempt to find my shoes. "we can't find your shoes can you come back?" "no i can NOT come back.  this is my second time coming back" "oh." she sits down and asks the other kid to find the phone number for the guy. returns to eating chinese food. meanwhile i notice ONE of my boots (one boot, not the pair) just chillin on the shelf alone - wtf after an eternity of waiting, an adult finally shows up, goes digging around and finds the rest of my shoes. with no apology.  they do an okay job but for the money you could go somewhere else that does a better job and has better customer service.
EFg854TCCJ0pTinc9TVG0Q : For $299 an evening, you TOO can party like a B-LIST ROCKSTAR.  Pad around the outdoor patio BAR shoeless and drunk . . . (as long as you're still clutching your Manolos, it's ok.)  Dial-up the valet to fetch your gold clutch and ciggies from the car . . . (man, this beats any boyfriend!)  Bail-out friends-of-friends from the wrath of the bouncer-out-front-with--the-velvet-rope  . . .  "He's with ME!  I'm in Suite 1000!  What's your name again?!"  Order up room service 24 hrs a day . . . while simultaneously eyeing the mini-bar stocked full of goodies.  If only EVERY weekend were like this!
fSVxnWm90ZMz-JYQYa3-HA : I went here with friend one saturday afternoon (we decided a pub crawl was a great way to celebrate my move :) and stopped in here bc it looked like a great place to sit outside and have a frosty beverage. Not so. We each had to rattle off a series of drinks before we doind something that they had. We did not stay for a second one.
09dtLobNps73V3WjF8chkw : Mike & Molly's seems like a decent place to grab a drink with friends, but it didn't strike me as being anything special.    I liked sitting outside on a beautiful night, and appreciated that I could hear my friends over the music.  I was also appreciative of the staff member who asked a guy who was being obnoxious and bothering us to leave.    To me, this place was incredibly cheap for the selection and quality of beer they offered, but then again, I'm used to drinking in Chicago, and paying for it accordingly.     And heads up, apparently, there is a cover charge (a whopping $1) on nights without live music.  Makes up for the cheap beer, I guess.
dXwzp-ePIctONGKqhQ6geg : Yes, the periodic table menu is very cool, and it has a happening nighttime bar scene.    But this review will be about their brunch, because it is our go-to place for a reliable and delicious meal.  There is always ample seating, which is nice on a Sunday morning when you're super hungry and trying to nurse a hangover.  We've tried pretty much every item on the brunch menu but the favorites are the Brazilian steak & eggs and Sourdough French Toast.  A side order of the jalapeno chicken sausage is also a must!  Also there is usually plenty of parking on Mass Ave which is a plus.
0ui2bAOg88my9Uk_QUNavA : The most unique aspect of Olivia is the restaurant itself. Formerly a train station, the building was renovated and redesigned by Cornell Professor and Architect Milton S. Curry and others. The dining room has some very unique art, trendy light fixtures, a cork board wall, and terrible acoustics, but what do you expect out of an old train station?  The menu is minorly upscale with several deliciously descriptive items. I've had the salmon sandwich and several others, only one that didn't agree with my taste buds (too much aioli, I suspect?) Nonetheless, Olivia's close location to campus makes it a favorite among professors and staff. The service is adequate but not exceptional, and I can't comment on their wine list, as I've never eaten at Olivia for dinner.
h4uMtiymsqiaMoph6x8T4w : Good pizza, great salad, loud restaurant.
YdL1NcrU5H7bcRx52CdBsA : I am shocked that I had such a great experience here, but I sure am happy that I did!   I thought we were crazy trying to come here on Cinco de Mayo actually trying to eat something. Of course, I was daunted by the long line forming outside, and the crowded tent on the side. But I tried to be optimistic and put my name in as soon as I arrived even though the rest of my party was not yet there. They gave me a buzzer and told me to come back when everybody showed up. My girlfriend was stuck in traffic so it ended up being close to 45 minutes by the time we were all gathered. By then we were told that we were next in line, and we watched with amazement as the Border Cafe team went through their routine. We followed, passing our little paper on to the hostess downstairs, receiving our free Dos Equis t-shirts, sitting down in the coziest, quietest nook in the basement. Our server was super friendly, the margaritas were delicious, and the food was tasty... all for a completely reasonable price!   Was the food excellent? No, definitely not, so that's where I take off a star. But it was good cheap tex-mex fare, and overall we had a great time!
Gy0erXWDa896fcAe25pDnQ : Its cheap that's exciting... I get it.   Cream is just not for me. For a small price you get a 2 overly sweet cookies (taste identical to the toll house cookies) slapped together with semi decent ice cream.
4vVYdTXG2Zf6gTop7TBNlQ : BLAKES does suck! And badly! Bad management and dirty.  Wrong wrong wrong!  The only one good thing that came out of it - I met my hubby there. Haha!
6A9BifJfc2HiDllkEVzbtg : I LOVE Zankou Chicken!! The garlic butter sauce is the BEST!!!! I always get the half chicken plate. They give you HUGE portions too! I'm always super full and super satisfied after my meal, with some chicken leftover too. The chicken tastes soooo good with the pita bread, garlic sauce, and hummus! MMMM! But it comes with some beets which aren't so great so I always end up leaving them on the side. Besides the beets, this place is DELICIOUS!
-kvNf3TB_ughkDB_3NLm8Q : I am being perhaps too generous with this rating. Consider this a 3.5 rating, really, but I'm happy there is the 77 bus in any case, so I'm rounding up.  This basically runs along Mass Ave between Harvard Square all the way through Arlington. As an Arlington resident, I'm glad we have it.   But oh I do wish we had indicators at our bus stops or something telling us how late the bus will be. They don't run on schedule, and they often cluster (no 77 buses for a half hour, and then suddenly THREE AT ONCE!)   Very handy bus, well-traversed. I just wish we knew when it was coming. Often times in the evenings it's faster to walk between Harvard and Arlington center than to wait for the bus, and considering that's about 4 miles, that doesn't make much sense, does it?
w5o6_LpUe_ycyQsWKCQ-QA : Oh sheeet!  New York style pizza in the Boston hiz-ouse!!  Finally someone in Boston knows how to make that paper thin crust with a thick, fluffy "handle."  The pepperoni slice only had about 3 little pieces of pepperoni on it but both that and the tomato basil slice were deliciously garlicky and flavorful.  I didn't really need two of these oversized slices, but they were cheap, so I indulged.  I've yet to try the sammiches but the ones I was eyeing on others plates looked pretty magically delicious.  There is also a wide variety of drinks, chips, and cute little packaged salads, all ready to go for us workers who have to scoot on back to our glamorous jobs in dilapidated houses...  My boss is a real New Yahkah and she's a big fan of Oggi, so if you don't trust me, trust her much older and wiser opinion.  (Heh.)
z5bZ9lDb5lH8RX7jbnKpdg : Big Red Hockey is infamous at Cornell. Unfortunately, the Lynah Stampede of 2005 resulted in a change to how line numbers (that's right... there was a stampede over line numbers. Not even tickets...) are distributed. Luckily, you still have to have the experience of "camping" out all weekend in Bartels Hall for season tickets!  It's worth it though, not just for a season of watching men's hockey kick butt, but, of course, for the famous Lynah fans and cheers. It's really quite an experience!  - "Boring! Boring!" Followed by newspaper throwing.. - "The rocket's RED glare" - "It's all your fault! It's all your fault!" - "Hey goalie, your mom called, and she said YOU SUCK" - "Section O sucks!" - "Safety school" And of course... - "We're gonna beat the hell outta you! Rough 'em up! Rough 'em up! Go CU!"  Let's go Red!
aJpADNlc7HsFLelDyU5sCw : Pretty tasty, but it's a tad bit spicier coming out than it is going in if you catch my drift.
0wcP5TeyeNTe-261jbNh5Q : Came here to visit my best friend at her college Cal Poly. We decided to grab something to eat. Since this was her town now, she recommended a place that had really good tri-tip and fries. So, we came to Firestone Grill. It was very crowded and the line went from inside to outside. I was really pleased with my tri-tip. It was very delicious and the fries were outstanding.  Pros - Great food and the workers were friendly. Fountain drinks !!!! Free REFILL !!! The menu is kind of small but the food is great. Always crowded. Indoor and outdoor seating.  Cons - The lines are LONG if its a really busy day. Like all places with outdoor seating. Eating outside when its windy is a NO NO.   I would definitely come back here when I visit again. 3 hour drive for a sandwich ? BRING IT ON !
lTgBA5NSXKYeF_bqv-A18Q : Dang, I busted up my hand playing soccer -- a sport where you're not supposed to use your hands.  Talk about a freak accident.    Anyway, Dr. Brown -- he's a Dukie (went to Duke University).  Normally, I'd take off major points for that b/c they're all nerds.  But when you're looking for a good doctor, a nerd is what you want.  Even though it was busy, I was in and out in 30 minutes.  But more importantly, I didn't feel rushed.  The diagnosis and treatment mirrored that of my doctor - whom I completely trust.  He took the time to craft mini splints that are custom to my long and fat fingers.  (That's right women, long and fat fingers and you know what that means.)    So, my fingers are in splints for 6 weeks and hopefully I won't need surgery.  If I do need surgery, then I know Dr. Brown is going to take care of me.
iIakMKdDvaTD_DNka9u0nA : I eat here pretty often. They have some really good subs and pizza. I usually get the Philly or the psuedo Ruben with some onion rings. Their pizza is some of the best in the NRV, and the white sauce is pretty good too.
26ezReSqrziV56TM2ao7Vg : I'm new to the area and took my kitty in for some vaccinations and a check-up.  I couldn't be happier with the staff, the tech that we saw, and the Vet.  Most of all, it seemed like they cared and took time to answer our questions.  Glad to have found a new vet that I trust and will see again!
XGKhRf3tggSH7UrzfpORCQ : The Asian Fusion restaurant had a great artsy atmosphere with attentive service. We started with the Peanut Dumplings and Tofu Delight, both were excellent. We had the Panang Curry with Tofu and brown rice on the side. The use of pumpkin in the dish sealed the deal for me. My first spoon of the curry vindicated our choice. The taste of the spicy coconut based gravy and vegetables blending with the sweetness of the pumpkin was tantalizing to say the least....a taste explosion! We also had the Sizzling Seafood (shrimp, scallop, black mussels, crab and basil with spicy chili & garlic sauce)
uAhxoitlf3C0G5Be0qYXRw : First of all, Pick Up Stix has some pretty good Cream Cheese Wontons.   Second, to the entrees. The only entrees I've ever had in my 5-6 visits to Pick Up Stix was the Crispy Honey Chicken and the House Special Chicken. Both of them were alright, but I thought the H.S. Chicken was too stringy. And the last time I came here, I saw that the H.S. Chicken I ordered came out of a heater cabinet thing when it was really suppose to be coming fresh out of a wok. Isn't that what Pick Up Stix is all about?   The brown rice is alright, not the best i've had. I've never tried their white rice, but it probably tastes like all white rices.   Concerning prices, I think that it's a bit too high for the portions I received. I paid $7.29 for the HS Chicken and brown rice. I think it's probably worth $5.50 at the most.  I guess I would come here again, although not on a regular basis. I prefer authentic Chinese myself and not these Americanized Chinese restaurants like Panda Express or PF Chang's (which is the most overpriced restaurant ever!)
uepsXyuKNiTHjeQfche7CA : I must admit, I am addicted to the Miracle of Science atmosphere. It's a great place to start off the night with good (sometimes out-of-context) music and cheap (GOOD!) beers.    I love the whole industrial-feeling setup and the snazzy outfits the servers are wearing on occasion. It's also a nice proximity if you feel like going to other Central bars after ... if that's your style. It's not mine, so I drink a beer, eat a properly cooked mid-rare burger and take the 1 Bus back to Hynes. Because I'm too old and not washed up enough to spend Saturdays in CS.
YExDWk1MioG-gcQS5IQt7A : While being bored at work and having nothing to do on a Friday afternoon, it seems like the perfect time to catch up on reviews of places from my past (today lets cover Boston and surrounding areas).  One of the most memorable places I discovered during my summer at Harvard 3 years ago was Pinocchio's, a staple for Harvard University students almost as much as Cheeseboard or Zachery's are for student at UC Berkeley.  There was no seating space and relatively no ambiance, but quick service and delicious pizza. I remember going there on a regular basis with friends and having the chicken pesto pizza. I would always ask for the corner slices of the sicilian pizza to get extra of their amazing crust. I could easily go unnoticed, but it certainly provided great pizza (even late at night) while we were in the area. Not the best pizza I've had, but it gets an extra star for the convenience at the time and probably nostalgia
dXUPpySFOVvmen2R9cflVA : Although I'm a frequent patron of the Albany Daily Grind, I'd never been to the Troy location until last weekend. After attending our friend's art opening as part of Troy Night Out, we gave up on trekking to the other shows because of the increasingly heavy snow fall. We decided to warm up with some hot drinks.  Same coffee, same drinks, but the locaion is a far cry from the beloved Albany basement location. The Troy DG is spacious and well-arranged, and they frequently have live music. I wish I could somehow take this location and stick it on Lark Street. Now that would be ideal...
ahpVp5IGVso2FLTp5Wp67g : Loved the veal chop! The asparagus with provolone was good too... Although the marinara sauces was not the best...
uL7wcaHcSeS8aCp_AMLFLA : Eve is a very interesting restaurant.  I would definitely take a date here, as it seems to me to be the ideal kind of restaurant for that.  It's set quietly off the brick roads of Kerrytown, almost hidden from the rest of Ann Arbor.  Very unique vibe inside and clearly a romantic destination.    As far as food goes, this place really isn't for me.  You should look the menu over before going because it is seasonal and if you are a picky eater, you may not find something you like.  If you do see something you like I can tell you this: Eve will make sure it's prepared perfectly, served on time by a conscientious waitstaff and absolutely delicious!  Even though the food generally isn't for me, I can honestly recommend this place.  Everyone I have recommended it to has told me they were quite pleased.   Ps.  Don't skip out on dessert.  This is where, in my opinion, Eve truly excels!
UjvssfF2ScoV_r0mpDEtyA : Service, happy staff, incredible selection of freshly made delish dishes...Cham more than satisfied my comfort food need. Try the tofu pouches with blue crab or pickled seaweed. The bibimbap was served sizzling hot as it should be with an assortment of veggies and the required egg in the center. Nice mixture of brown rices made it a healthy meal indeed! Don't miss this little powerhouse of a cafe. Cham will not disappoint! Happy hour discounts too. Yum!
bpkpLZEbOi86pDYqsEWG-g : Sip is cute, cozy and delicious! It's a place you could easily walk by and not even notice. The service is always friendly and on point. The coffee is from a french press, which makes it 100x better than drip coffee that has been sitting forever. And of course, there is the Sipwich. It's actually not even on the menu anymore, but still totally available to order. The Sipwich is a delicious egg sandwich topped with all sorts of little delights. Personally, I get a Sipwich with an extra egg, cheese, ham and avocado. My friend gets an extra egg and chorizo. Of course you must also order a side of Billionaire Bacon...because everyone knows no Sipwich is complete without Billionaire Bacon. Sip has become my go-to spot for a comforting breakfast after a late night. I will also admit that I haven't ordered anything else off the menu. I have friends who have ordered the french toast and it was pretty good, but very sweet. It's more like a dessert than a breakfast.   You must feel comfortable sitting very close to people and having a lack of table privacy to come to Sip. Normally, that would bother me, but Sip rocks it with service and food. So with that, I'm forgiving of my lack of personal space. This is not a place for groups. Normally, I only come here with one or two other people and it's perfect.
IwlMVIiS-KB1FJeSomKUWA : Absolutely my favorite restaurant in town and this location should be an institution. I regularly go there for brunch with my parents, happy hour with friends, and randomly for dinners with friends. Their menu is expansive and offers lots of choices with plenty of veggie and non-veggie options. I love the pecan crusted chicken. The scallops are also wonderful.   The only time I've ever been upset is when they were out of chicken and waffles for brunch this past weekend when I went there. Disappointed but nevertheless I had the breakfast plate which was tasty as well. The muffins at brunch are also wonderful little treats.   I highly recommend you check this place out if you are around the neighborhood.
Qq8cVClkm459KroRb3yU0g : Club Passim is great.  I've been coming here for about 6 years and have never seen a bad show.  The venue is intimate with delicious food and drinks.  You can feel pretty squished if all the tables are full but I consider that a small price to pay for the overall great experience of seeing a show here.  I also love that they support local (incredibly talented) artists and also offer music lessons.
MP1Qqb8mbADbYAdm_tUtSw : A bit expensive, but great food, and an even better atmosphere.  The restaurant is actually a house with the seating broken up into different rooms.  Maybe 3 tables per room.
h50IGBOqLhMIspOhvTnyWg : I thought it was a cute little spot for breakfast.  It's on a quiet side street and just very cute.  The food was good and someplace that I would go to if I was in the area.
WaM6ZqppAsdsgrxi9DbDBA : I am picky with dry-cleaners, and so far, this is the only place I've found in the L.A. area that is up to snuff.  I brought a bright orange skirt there which was covered with stains, including one that I tried to remove with salt (the owner explained that this actually _sets_ stains!).  They removed all the stains beautifully, and even repaired a loose hem at no extra charge.  It's not cheap--about double what other cleaners cost--but really worth it for garments you care about.
lN-4lygrFgOtsuO9WjBYrg : Went there for breakfast yesterday, and was very disappointed. When we first went in and sat down, the seat was loose and i almost fell through the bench. Then they eventually came to take our drink order and bring our menus. the staff was not very hospitable at all. She seemed annoyed. We did not get our food as cooked and when we told them, she took it away and never brought anything back. Overall a definite disappointment. Also it was a little too expensive for what it was. No chocolate chip pancakes at all.
NVI1cbHjpjZYplB47svdug : Tops in the nation in many departments, but they don't cater to their undergrads the way they should, and forget it if you're a non-traditional student.  I've often thought they should change their name to 'Illinois A&M' because Engineering and Ag are their strengths.  Undergraduates will frequently have grad teaching assistants (who have little interest or talent for teaching) for their 100- and 200-level courses.  The campus has a lot to offer in terms of culture and the arts, but the education is best had by grad and professional students.  How did they put it?  'At Illnois, you're not a number, you're nine numbers.'  So definitely apply, but understand that the comparitively lower tuition than that of large private universities means giving up that feeling that you're a VIP.
Nj7qrrWoMtrBtUidxjUVzA : Stan's has really fresh, good-quality food at a fair price.  It's also the best deli-style sandwich you're going to get in the Drexel area.  They have quasi-Jewish style sandwiches and a variety of hoagies.  I personally order a cheese hoagie with some veg on top, which I think is about $7 (but it's two meals-worth for me).  They also have surprisingly good milk shakes, for anyone who has the need to eat dessert after every meal (or during the meal in this case).  They close pretty early, but it's possibly because they can't compete with the nearby pizza shops.  Also, it makes them seem more like an authentic deli :)  P.S. Just in local comparison, this place is better than the Nosh on Market St, Abner's, or any of the other sandwichy places that I can think of in the area.
SGaGsbCco9L0XiD0p1HVSA : The English Cellar is one of those places that seems cooler than it actually is.  It has a good location (right off of Thayer) which is a short walking distance from my apartment.  It has a decent beer selection (boasting 200 plus beers, although only about 8-10 on draft).  On the other hand, on the weekend evenings, when all the college kids are out partying, it gets loud, boisterous (and not in the good way). I don't mind a place being loud because of people having a good time or if there is a good live band playing.  I do, however, mind when the management is playing crappy 90s rap music so loud you can't have a conversation with the person right next to you.  There was table service in the bar, but our waitress never came back after stating she would give us a few minutes to look over the beer menu.  The person busing our tables was rude in a non verbal way.  The beer is also pretty expensive, but I excpected that at an establishment aimed at wealthy college kids. I will probably be back because it is convenient and they are open until 2am, but it is definitely not the prime choice if you are looking for a real English pub or to have a conversation with friends.  If you are looking for a place to drink expensive beers and watch college kids get hammered, then you are in luck.  I am giving the Cellar three stars instead of two only because both times I have gone have been on weekend nights and I do believe I would have had a different experience on a quieter night.  They also get an extra star for a great beer selection and the fact that the manager is very friendly.
h7CvR0hKYdzU73FqY524mg : A Harvard Square landmark in its own respect this place delivers, delivers some damn good pieces of ground beef between pieces of bread.  Seeing as the burgers here speak for themselves I can spend the rest of this review writing lies and damn lies:  1) Eating the George Bush burger will lead to immortality. 2) Adolph Hitler didn't commit suicide, he came to Bartley's and didn't have any cash or an ATM card.  It was the fry cook who did him in. 3) The last supper actually consisted of Yuppie Burgers and Jesus actually said, "Take this all of you and eat it, this is one of the best burgers on the planet."  Afraid that the Romans would steal the secret of the burgers and pervert it for evil, it was changed to bread and wine.         3a) The burgers had all been consumed before they got to Judas...we all know what happened next. 4) If you rub two Viagra burgers together you can create fire.  If you put another burger between it will cause the apocalypse. 5) Freebird was neither composed nor originally played by Lynyrd Skynyrd.  It was done by Albert Mann, an 8 year old boy, upon taking the first bite of his Burger Supreme.  Without a guitar he used the chair leg and shoelaces.  He rocked so hard there were no survivors.  Since then the staff has made sure that the chair legs cannot be ripped off. 6) The A-Rod burger can be used as a form of contraceptive.  It is 100% safe and is simultaneously for both his and her pleasure.  7) The Japanese monster Godzilla actually got its name from the Godzilla sized Raspberry Lime Ricky.  A Japanese man, after returning from Boston, found the monster only slightly more ominous than the humongous beverage. 8) Helen of Troy was not a woman, rather it was The People Republic of Cambridge Burger in a wig.
Z1lgcLchlOI0md1kiZorgQ : I give them 3 stars because of their Panang Curry, this is the only thing I've ever ate in the past and have loved it, must get it to go though as they have very limited seating. Recently tried the Phad Thai and the Vegetable with Peanut Sauce dish and cannot say I was a huge fan. Phad thai was overwhelmingly spicey at 2 stars, and the Vegetable with peanut sauce was not that spicey at 3 stars, just a little incosistent. Maybe I haven't tried enough dishes, I don't know possibly. Curry is great though!  Remember cash only!
HT6ZCRcPYHo7nkGWZiHYAw : ok, i really don't understand what's so great about this place. i love mediterranean/middle eastern food...but no, not zankou...i really wanted to like this place. it's relatively cheap, fast and not absolutely terrible for you. the hummus or garlc sauce or whatever on my chicken shwarma made it almost inedible for me.  i won't be going back anytime soon.  that being said, a lot of people swear by this place...
NQ257er8CpLgTD7o67d2sg : Tried out the Corner part, not the main restaurant. You can sit in there, as well as get pick-up/take out orders filled. Got the pulled chicken BBQ special. Tasty chow, large potions. Price was right, certainly seemed fair. Fries were ginormous! Service was ace, very friendly.  Plus they have a huge menu. You almost don't know where to start! I can definitely see me eating here again.
92B55uXNt_FhR5LLfRZ8Sg : I went to this place with my friend on a late sunday night. It was around 830pm and the place was packed! OH, and this place is pretty well hidden....so look carefully!   We were seated right away. So, that was good.   The service here is good...attentive much! The girl who helped us out knew what she was talking about!  We ordered pretty everything that yelpers recommended me. They all turned out to be really good (=   I ended up spending 70 some bucks, but it was def. worth it! (=   I recommend this place for first dates.
jcJnScbNR-W-I4rm_gEfsQ : Currently, its probably operating at 4 star level.  When Bob was there, it was easily 6 star level -- truly amazing (people would wait for hours outside in the cold!).  So I average that to 5 stars.
oGJjbiDjfZzWJCRMtjbjzQ : I'm so happy to have found good Indian food in the neighborhood. The vindaloo is HOT HOT HOT spicy. Love it! The chicken tikka massala is so creamy I can feel my love handles growing as I eat. And the naan is really soft and smooth. I know it's just bread, but somehow it's so much better than bread.  It's one of those places you order at the counter and they bring you the food. The atmosphere is quite informal, but clean and friendly (unlike nearby Naan 'n Curry).
siR6Z7zlkrh-3zmiMF25Xg : I'm totally a fan of the Gypsy Cafe. I come here often (I was there last night) and always get the same thing: The Meat Mezza Platter and a side of the yogurt-- tender chicken kabobs, beef, steak, kibe, hummus, tabbouleh, and salad-- enough to comfortably feed 2-3 people and is AWESOME! (And only cost like $18)  I know you seasoned Hookah fans out there smoke out of an apple, but they offer an ORANGE-- This was life changingly good!! You can taste the orange right through the pipe and smoke! Starbuzz peach with an orange and you'll be in hookah-heaven! It even makes it taste a little cooler-menthol like.   I liked the bottle service... until last night (only $40 for a bottle and juice) BUT** after 3 vodka and crans I noticed nothing... not even a half of a buzz. College was years ago, and I can't withstand alcohol like that... needless to say, I did a little looking around on the bottle and I noticed the Vodka only is 24% alcohol making it 48 proof. What??? Lol. I've drank wine with more alcohol than that! So-- no more Vodka from Gypsy, but the meat and hookah will definitely keep me coming back!  (Also, if you're not cool with the hookah and smoke you can call in and place an order for carry-out and have a tasty dinner!)
BK1sd2jVYGiTi_rz_n_VTQ : Basically, I was appalled this theater earned 3 stars. I'll say this. It's "fine".... FOR BOSTON. Like so many other things in Boston, it probably would be acceptable if this were 50 years ago. But it's not. So either charge like it's 50 years ago, or stop ripping me off.  Thor "3d" was $14 because it included "glasses".... which you give back afterward. So why charge us? And the 3d doesn't work unless the projector is bright enough. The screens are tiny. The sound is like listening to $10 computer speakers.  I didn't really get upset at things like HVAC, bathrooms, staff quality. But the key thing in a theater above all to me is the screen and the sound. Which were both about the equivalent of watching a 36" TV with built-in speakers. So for that,....... why go to a theater?
QbOqTpmw984RyLloHDvTUA : I went in for my cupcake fix today and they had a blueberry pancake cupcake.  It. was. awesome.  What absolutely impressed me was the maple frosting. I normally am not a big frosting fan but this frosting was divine. I'm still leaving a star off because not all their cupcakes are created equal. This one was definitely one of their good ones.  (But there is a black lab in Harvard Square that would give them five stars, if she knew how to use a computer. She licked my hands clean when I was done.)
lkGsjitOOF0u29ayBc8WBA : This is my kind of store.  Locally owned (by three women), everything can be tested before you buy (there are really beautiful sinks for your hands and feet at the back of the store), inexpensive ($6 for 4oz of bath gel-your own scent combinations), and wonderful-smelling essential oils to choose from/mix together.  Oh, and they keep your "recipes" on file for future reference while shopping.  Less to remember.  Awesome!  Narrowing down my oils was difficult for me.  Deer in the headlights, once again.  The employee was very patient, letting me take my time.  She offered suggestions if asked, but mainly kept to herself.  I didn't feel rushed.    For those of you Bath Junkie  ...uh junkies, this place has most of those standard scents (ha!), but many, many more.  Ume blossom, sweet olive blossom (I really like sweet olive trees),  four separate Magnolia scents, several types of vertiver...  The list was extensive.
WaplvrxToLLoPTZTp7iBPQ : VEGETARIANS BEWARE!  This place pulled one of the sleaziest moves. My girlfriend ordered the EBLT without bacon. It showed up with bacon, so we politely asked them to take it back and prepare a new one. I should have been suspicious when a new sandwich appeared within 5 minutes. When she opened up the "new" sandwich there was a half a strip of bacon still stuck to the bread. All they did was pull the bacon out and flip the sandwich over so it would look different.  For a place that tries to pass itself off as somewhat classy, a move like this is despicable and shows they have no respect for vegetarians.Really, really lame.  The manager came over and apologized profusely but offered no explanation for what they had done. The gesture of removing the charge for that sandwich from the bill was meaningless, as any rational person would expect that as a minimum, and also because by that point we were so angry and disgusted my girlfriend had no appetite.
NYvLrIuin8OJDTFAD9DfAA : The only words you need to know is "Spicy Pork Bugogi Bowl"  mmk? It's delicious; it's filling; it's served piping hot and spicy hot.  Great bowl of rice with heaps of pork that's coated in a red hot sauce with sauteed onions.  YUM.  Only gripe: A little $$, minimal seating, and long long LONG waits at lunch.  Otherwise...go get the pork.
BH1tZuNCnYhphzVVG7Kv0A : I am from Boston, but I spend a lot of time in the east bay. A friend recommended Dale to me, so I decided to give his services a try. He's wonderful. I have lose curls, and his cuts make my curls fall perfectly. The overall shape of my cut is excellent (i.e., not to short, choppy, or triangular, and not to long and limp). In addition, his cuts last for months and months. I have been to the most expensive salons in Boston, but none can beat Dale's services. He's also very down to earth and nice to be around :).
J_FZC9IIEBm9kNR3qjBMHQ : so many choices! there's literally an entire menu full of "burgers" all with a namesake which makes it fun. i'm not sure what about the guacamole & cheddar burger makes it a "tom brady", but that's what it's called.  definitely go here with the right mentality though. be prepared to wait, be prepared for loud & crowded, be prepared for a busy waitstaff, and be prepared for the price (a little bit pricey for a burger). if you're ok with those - then you'll enjoy the burger which is really the feature, despite all of the other distractions added to it. mine was perfectly medium rare and had an awesome crust to it. so good.  only negative about bartley's for me is that they have sesame buns. on the plus side, i finished my entire burger & fixings!  mm - i was really hoping i could have tried the "mayor" with the bacon, cheese, AND fried egg!
eFFIWS8dU7SR715EaqIbxQ : Gotta agree with Sylvie D.'s review. Donut fanatics that like all sorts of eclectic combinations will appreciate Stan's Doughnuts and will be willing to pay the $2.75 for a premium donut. I'm not one of them.  After reading through Yelp reviews, I thought the Peanut Butter and Fresh Bananas donut would be out-of-this-world, I-would-give-up-my-firstborn-for-this amazing. It was neither. I guess I was expecting a more even distribution of peanut butter and banana flavor. The banana sort of got lost in the whole mix, and I basically tasted just peanut butter. Siiigh... disappointment.   Maybe if they had named it just "Peanut Butter," I wouldn't have had such high expectations.   I'll be going back to Stan's Doughnuts and NOT reading any Yelp reviews before I decide on something this time to minimize bias.
ETQyXbB8QBvN4-k4qo7_WQ : Green St is a little gem tucked away in Shopper's Lane off of Lake Ave in Pasadena.  If pressed to describe their food, I'd say "Stop pressing me to describe their food!"  Then I'd say something corny but true like "California fresh": Lotsa big entree salads, sandwiches, interesting quesadillas (the asaparagus & corn was yum), and of course their fabulous zucchini bread, that thank heavens comes with just about everything.  A few imported beers on tap too (that weren't on the menu) including a Hefeweizen that was delicious.  Good service, pleasant, not a date spot (less you're in the AARP set) but a good place to take the 'rents.  Valet parking but you can park just across the street for 2 hrs free.
YOB8vK0dj06_9Zrf3yqBBA : A lovely welcome to the otherwise mundane Princeton shopping district, which seems to be more geared towards ice cream/frozen yogurt stores or overpriced restaurant fare. Whether or not you buy anything (because it is slightly more expensive that Toys R' Us), the experience itself is certainly worth recreating. And that's why I keep coming back.  Quality products. Friendly staff. Cool store.
XKy5G9FUBp2R9hbfcrCmSA : I really like this place for lunch but can't take it any other time.  They offer a cool MIT atmosphere and laid back service. The menu is really small, and rarely changes, but it does offer one vegetarian meal and some other burgers, bar food etc. All good. soup's good too.  Beer and food are cheap. The service is just attentive enough so they do a good gob, but let you chill while you eat and hang with friends. During the day everyone is nice.  It annoys me later in the night due to the type of crowd and of how packed it gets with these people.
7AgrXVrm4Ehmbve5EFA91w : YUMMY.   The amount of food you get is kind of ridiculous. I might go so far as to say that you can share an entree.   Vegetable samosas - Yea, definitely the best I have ever had. The puffs were crisp and tender at the same time. The filling was soft and at first tasted sweet, but then gave a sour punch. The brown sauce that came with it - What was that? Because it was DELICIOUS!   So, I have to insert the entree I ate from the online menu because I am not too familiar with Indian cuisine :   "Beef Curry Thali Minka Farms grass-fed grain-finished beef in a rich garam masala, star anise, coconut milk gravy. Served on a thali with rice, dal, bhaji, chutney, chapati and pappadum. $17"   The beef curry was very, very tender. Fall over on itself with spicilious-ness amazing. The grass fed beef part ? Yea, it's legit and you can taste the difference. The yogurt concoction - yup sweet and refreshing and helped me de-stress.   The tandoori chicken was surprisingly moist. Every time I have had tandoori chicken it has been dry, not this chicken. Go for it and don't be afraid - moist and flavorful.   The only downside is that we waited 40 minutes for our order, which would have been okay, but I was starving. Upside - the dinner reheats really well in the microwave for a next day lunch/dinner.
ajteTTY9Dm-uBWXfvfFcyw : My palms sweat when I hear the word dentist.    I had to leave the theater the first time I saw Laurence Olivier's interrogation technique in "Marathon Man."  If I was in a dog cage in our top-flight correctional institution at Guantanamo, all you'd have to do to get me to give up the names of my terrorist cell buds AND the 72 virgins I was promised is put a dental drill on the table.  And I was a cavity-prone pre-fluoridated water kid, meaning my childhood was a dental hell leaving me with many fillings showing their age and needing upkeep.  Yet even after I explained all this, even after I insisted that I take gas for a CLEANING, Dr. Lessner took me on as a challenge.  That was more than 10 years ago, and I'm still going.  First, the pain thing: there is none.  He humored me with gas the first few times,  (hee hee, pun intended) but as I gained confidence and he earned my trust I discovered that he is as deft with a Novocaine needle as any doc I have known, AND he lets it take effect fully before doing anything.  A gentle poke of a gingerly delivered needle and I am fine with whatever he has had to dish out.  His hygienists and office staff show remarkably low turnover--most of the same folks who worked there when I started going are still there, and seem to enjoy their work.  They are friendly, competent and respectful of my foibles.  I consider him to be a craftsman of dental work, especially since I have had 6 crowns installed there (my remains will now be much easier to identify if I am ever burned beyond recognition).  Sure the ceramic (and gold)  lab that makes the crowns is great, but it is he who ensured the fit, and avoided nasty things like root canals when old fillings or molars broke.  I found him because he advertised in the Texas Triangle, a now defunct Austin gay& lesbian newspaper.  I like to patronize GLBT community advertisers, so I gave him a try.  His ad photo was HOT, and yes, that colored my initial decision to get more info about him.  In fact, after a few visits, I thought he was gay--nice, but something I didn't care about one way or another as far as dental work was concerned.  Three adorable kids later I know I was mistaken, but he IS easy on the eyes.  He's an avid cyclist and rock climber, and it shows.  I like him enough to have recommended a dozen or more friends, now patients.  Hell, I like him enough to have gotten a gift for his firstborn--which his newest li'l tyke is still playing with.  He's a good dentist, period.  It's a small personal office, in a tiny bungalow with limited parking, but it's filled with people who know what they are doing, and like doing it.  Even though dentist  remains a word that strikes fear in my heart, I happily recommend Dr. Michael Lessner.
h5VswRPMwVngb-pQnHzAVA : There are places where you watch football, and then there is the Coliseum. It's not the Rose Bowl ladies and gentlemen-- it's better. The Coliseum is big, and it looks big. You can't help thinking to yourself if there are five people here then there are 500,000 people here. There's just something about this place that's majestic, it's seen the greats and you just know it's patiently waiting for more to blitz through.   Is this the world's newest stadium with toilets that flush for you and red carpets that unfurl in front of you like you're the Dalai Lama of the pigskin? Hell no. But you're a football fan, aren't you? You came for the atmosphere, for the grit and the glamor that this place has to offer, not the automatic soap dispensers. If it's a great stadium you're looking for, you've found it. If you want a historic venue that oozes fourth and inches with a "Big Balls Pete!" chant reverberating through the seats, sit yourself right on down. If you want foam on your cappuccino while you sit in a padded seat, slightly distracted from the program by a football game...well, Stanford's just a few miles north.
FmfBRreNMlRwV2Y1bel60Q : Just went to this place and the barista was very clearly stoned. He royally messed up my order - after multiple corrections while giving it - and then had the gall to insist that he was right and that I clearly needed coffee.
5JZeto00oMGYkTb8FWFajQ : This was my 2nd "Triple D" in a matter of 3 days and it was pretty damn amazing.  Wasn't expecting it to be a breakfast spot too so at first I was torn on what to get... burger or full breakfast???  Well I went with the bacon cheeseburger it was super yummo, fries were a little cold, but they were crispy so I was a fan.  My sis got the "Drew Brees" that was really good - some of the best biscuits and gravy I've ever had (my dad and sister agreed).  My dad had the grilled tenderloin which was really good, just kind of small, two tenderloins would have been better... and the whole family agreed that the root beer was PERFECT.  Right amount of sweet with a hint of spicy.  Served in a frosted mug which always tastes better.  If I'm ever traveling on I-65 between Chi and Indy, I'm stopping.
dMaVOPBwb-PfdU4_xCo6XA : Totally wonderful food!!  Very clean restaurant..  The bibimbap (w/tofu) was delicious!  Presentation of the food, very eye appealing...  Will be going back...
T-mFd5hkNcBKkQOzPeD8eg : This is just on the North side of the campus area, in a retail center that was probably built in the 40's ??  Bricked and unassuming and the atmosphere in the restaurant was relaxed.  First I would like to say that to me the decor and what's on the walls falls far short and ranks third to the quality of the food & service provided.  With that said my date had the Bobo de Camarao (Best of chronicle winner) , which is shrimp and yucca  tossed with onions and bell peppers in a tomato coconut cream sauce, served with saffron steamed rice.  She thought it was excellent.  I had the Moqueca Bahiana, which was a salmon filet crispy fried and then covered with sauteed tomatoes, onions, peppers & cilantro in a coconut cream sauce. Served with saffron steamed rice and yucca porridge.  Mine was excellent as well and I don't how it could have been made any better.  The creme brulee was a nice ending to a great meal.  If you went with these choices I don't think you will be dissapointed.  My first venture with Brazilian cuisine and I will definitely be back to Sao Paulo's.
ArijcOR192BLroVstwpN-A : Jen F. has been raving about Potbelly to me for the longest time and telling me how great the sandwiches and smoothies are.  I hadn't eaten a sandwich in 2+ years (I know, I'm weird) so it seemed like a good idea to see if these sandwiches were any good.  I was surprised by the number of vegetarian options.  The sandwich with mushrooms and cheese was delicious, perfectly toasted, and only $4 for a WHOLE SANDWICH.  Maybe I'm so used to NYC prices, but this was a bargain.  The whole wheat bread was also really good.  The cookies by the cash register were torture to look at.   There's a pretty large seating area if you prefer to eat your sandwich there, or you can also take it to go.  It's such a relief that they don't post the nutrition facts in this place.  Ignorance is bliss.
X4YctNrcRhuqA32xcW9hlg : Caffeine a stone's throw from campus.  Their Americano's are consistently good,strong, and hot.  The outdoor seating is wonderful on a sunny day, but the pits if it's cold or wet. On bad days the limited indoor seating fills quickly.  And I really appreciate the hand sanitizer dispenser they have available.
xffEw6YcUoeD-dYVj92xnA : I wish there was better Korean food right around Berkeley campus, but there just isnt. Good thing about this place is you can get a nice hot tofu soup when the weather is chilly outside. I always get the Galbi tofu soup! Comes with a portion of rice and if you eat in, they give you side dishes! Their bibimbap is decent--definitely check out their daily deals because dishes are cheaper.  I've definitely tried better tofu soup, but this place will have to suffice!
_-CoDEs7kRfKhLL6yoYHTQ : Cute location in the Courtyard that actually has a coffee shop feel to it with some leather chairs and nice, slightly dimmer lighting. I'd go here to read or do work inside or outside. You can watch them do the baking, which is cool.  The coffee here has been good, and I enjoyed my cupcake, though I personally prefer the ones at Sugarland, which I think are a little more unique. The Bliss cupcakes are very light and airy. Another plus is that they offer vegan cupcakes, which if I was a vegan, I'd be ecstatic over. They change cupcake specials daily (with some regular weekly rotations) so if you have a favorite that isn't standard vanilla or chocolate, check the website to see what days they have it.
rZjTbYFfIdR9spaVMJFupw : So i'm gonna make this review short compared to my others ones. This place always called my attention as i like asian food and i always see it around.   So when i finally got a chance to try it i was expecting this place to blow me away. I had a seven sea soup and my gf had a noodle thai noodle dish that i can't recall.  My soup was ok, and the best highlight of it was that the seafood didn't require and work such as peeling. The only thing that i thought was really awesome about this place was that they had refills on thier thai iced tea. THAT ROCKS!!   Other than that the prices weren't too bad and i'd consider going back to check out other dishes to see if their any good.
ipia-bo_zNDxAVXQRReI0Q : Now I know where to go to get my Cal gear.  I have to admit, though, some of those Cal shirt colorings are a little bit off ... I still question if those things are authentic or not ....
G_lqurwNYgKfxxlFY88HfA : I printed a black and white poster there today. The service was very professional and prompt, the price was right, and all 4 people I interacted there with were very helpful.
_-pvGUjCHAnfMlPRObpJcw : For nearly 4 years, I thought Sunny's Diner was shut down and they just never got around to taking down the sign.  Turns out I just never woke up before 2pm.  Needless to say, since then, I've become a frequent visitor to this quaint little breakfast "hallway."  For those of you longing for good old-fashioned breakfast food that probably exceeds your caloric recommendation for the day, Sunny's is a great place that actually adds some quality to the grease.  The eggs are always done nicely, the home fries are seasoned well (sometimes a little on the salty side, it depends how deep the potatoes were in the basket when they seasoned them), and the pancakes are to die for.  Seriously, I never thought chocolate chip pancakes could taste that good.  The food, however, is a little on the pricey side, especially for breakfast.  Their signature "Gentle Giant" combo - 3 eggs, your choice of ham/sausage/bacon, home fries, and 2 pancakes (chocolate chip, regular, or blueberry), will cost you 8 bucks.  Surprisingly, however, the food isn't nearly as filling as it sounds.  My suspicion is that they don't give you 3 eggs...or at least, it definitely doesn't look like it.  Sunny's also serves omelets (great food, but also a little pricey at $6-8), breakfast sandwiches, and combinations of the above.  They do have a lunch menu, but I don't think I've ever seen anyone order from it.  Trust me, this place is for breakfast.  The waitress (there's only one for the entire place) is always busy, as she has to serve everyone in addition to being the cashier.  So forget about quick service, especially on weekend mornings when roughly all of MIT goes to get their after-party breakfast food.  If you want anything other than water, tea, or coffee, go to the fridge yourself and grab it.  Finding a table for more than 2 will be difficult, so don't try to bring big groups to this place.  If you're looking for some better quality breakfast, come to Sunny's.  If you just want piles of food, try Brookline Lunch down the street in Central Square or IHOP at Harvard.
Qj54Ib8oZZBQ5_Zp231Alw : 4 stars for being exactly what it aspires to be: a cheap, casual, order-at-the-counter Thai/Asian restaurant.  I've heard good things about Tin Drum from friends at Tech, and I decided to take my brother there for a quick bite after shopping at Barnes and Noble. He ordered the Chicken Pad Thai and one basil rice paper roll. I opted for the veggie soup and the garden salad with peanut dressing on the side.   After just about 5 minutes, the food was delivered to our table. All of the portions were generous, and many people could probably make two meals out of any of their main dishes. My brother's Pad Thai didn't look like something you could get at Tamarind Seed, but it was also only about a third of the price, and he cleaned his plate. He enjoyed the basil roll, too. I was pleasantly surprised by both my soup and salad. For just $3, I expected a cup of soup that skimped on the veggies; instead, I got a huge bowl that was piping hot and full of mushrooms, sprouts, celery (my least favorite), and green beans. After adding some sriracha to the light chicken/vegetable broth (bonus points for having this readily available to take to your table), it was perfect. The salad was crisp and fresh. The peanut dressing was a peculiar shade of neon orange, but it was good (definitely not the best or most authentic I've had, but decent). The total bill was between $18-$19.   If you're looking for quality Thai, this isn't the place. But if you're budget-conscious, short on time, and in need of a tasty, filling lunch, Tin Drum delivers. I'll be back.
QJFlKH2IW3p_XPIAIFsqXQ : the "best" frozen yogurt is a hotly contested subject. i actually found out about yelp from researching the creepy substance that was pinkberry. when i found out it was made like "soylent green" or "the stuff," i wanted to find the original real frozen yogurt.   in the 80s i ate at penguins and j. higbys. at j. higbys i got strawberry with gummy bears, and they would crystallize from the cold and like rip your teeth open, it was so awesome. i was excited when our soccer team had a fundraiser at J. Higbys. helllll yes.  but now i'm a grown up on the outside and i have more refined yogurt requirements. my favorite at red mango used to be watermelon and graham crackers, the best ever. they have taken both of those toppings away, pricks.  i still love their creamy frozen yogurt. bacteria is so weird, i don't like to think about it but actually i do. just because you swallow it, it doesn't die. it swims around inside of you and does lots of beneficial activities for your body. Wow! i tried cantaloop but it was too icy compared to this. if you like more icy type froyo go for cantaloop. creamsiclers, go to red mango.  5 stars is because in yelpland, 5 stars means "Woohoo! As good as it gets!" and in the frozen yogurt category, in los angeles (we are intentionally excluding yogurtland near miramar, which is truly the "top gun" of yogurt), Red Mango is the best. to me. i see from other reviews that almost no one agrees with me. that is fine i'm a vocal minority, baby.
-SpCWcQcqw4Ri3zmGbg8Yg : A decent buffet for the price, $9.75 for dinner, with all the fan favorites: General Tso's chicken, lo mein, fried rice, crab rangoon, etc with other items like Thai curries, french fries, fried bananas, etc.  Service is great.  Location is odd (underground) and outdated.
5xNOGYDjKRoj8UpD2vl5wg : I completely agree with the previous reviewers who said Bliss Westwood is NOT a zen-like, relaxing experience. The lighting is completely wrong (too bright in the very small locker rooms) and non-existent in the shower.    I have been to many spas and this one is overpriced, clinical, unsoothing and loud. Both the staff and the music they play makes you feel like you're in the mall and not a "high-end" spa.    The facial was fine but nothing special. The pedicure is NOT worth it. Even if it wasn't overpriced, I would never have one there again because the chairs are super uncomfortable. They sacrificed comfort for hipness.   Staff wasn't very friendly and the lounge area is not relaxing (it has white tile floors with chairs so upright you've never had better posture).   For facials, go to Skin Haven instead. For pedicures, go the $15 places down the street in westwood.
HRmTO4WYTBWW2nEaqiGxZw : This venue reminds me of everything that is wrong with the UC system.  The managers of the place didn't have a solid business plan and figured that rather than go bankrupt, they would repeatedly try to front the cost on students - as if we're not already getting fucked for our money enough by the regents. I've seen their  budget - they want hundreds of dollars to give Blackberries to their managers because they deem it 'necessary to conduct business'.  I do not approve.   I came here to see Thao Nguyen, and while the show was pretty good, the review is ultimately about the venue which is sterile at best. Attempts to create a venue that celebrates the arts while being profit-driven don't work and The Loft is prime example of this failure.
uP5dADx-1ETWx-gz5a16Dg : Good food. The chicken in my caesar salad was a little dry but my lunch companions enjoyed their food. We had a fantastic waiter who really anticipated our needs and made himself invisible except when we needed him. I liked the atmosphere.
t7jl6UqJMhDGnjKtdJ6Nkg : A big "Hola" to the free chips & salsa. I do love me some free chip and salsa establishments.  Now, not many people know this, but...I'm not Mexican. Nor have I ever been Mexican nor will I ever be Mexican. I come from a white Irish Catholic family who probably won't even let their gay son marry a nice Mexican boy...okay, that's a lie.  But in any case, I am no expert on what Mexican food should taste like. I've never even been south of the border. But I will tell you, I know food. And I know what tastes good. And the Border Cafe, my friends, TASTES GOOD.  So if I want Mexican food, or what I think Mexican food should taste like, I know that this crazy ass restaurant in Harvard Square exists.  Hola free chips & salsa. Te amo frozen margaritas.
wGvIeiEOg-ZlPOdoGnBZFA : Why didn't this place exist when I went to UT??   The food here is good. My favorite is the Brazilian Paella. My partner likes their Black Bean Stew. Order their side of collard greens to go with your meal. It is yummy! I also love their appetizers, especially the Parmesan Cheese Rolls. They are warm, springy, salty and savory. My favorite munchies.
E-H__df8hcDhIkcOog-X5w : The cookies are soft and chewy, the ice cream is...well...ice cream.  Putting the two together makes Diddy Riese sooooo good.  You can't go wrong with this place because their desserts are good and the price is amazing.  $1.50 for an ice cream sandwich!  Bring one to the Del Amo Mall!
Yzo2KMqWHRmTe4S61lgsgQ : Loved the place. I'm gonna be a regular here. At least twice a month.
4UTaf1OQQG_c9__126CU1g : This is a terrific addition to the Menlo Park / Palo Alto family eating circuit. I thought the pizza was absolutely delicious; we got cheese only, which was very tasty. The caesar salads were especially and unusually great; one of the best salads I've had in the area.    If you want to take your kids and other families for lunch or dinner, this place is definitely in Tier-1 in MP/Palo Alto.
jfTD1wNpQsq6aosxAkSzFw : I've returned several more times, and the last is certain to be my last.  I saw bugs, people! A great big roach crawled on the bench seating next to me.  On this visit, the food was barely warm and the waiters inattentive.  But really, the roach grossed me out.
9HDsSv9MNYNg_WOlZ9xF_A : I had this for the first time, but I went to the little hole in the wall on 83rd and Broadway. Yeah a little guetto but highly recommended and just had to try it. WOW the Asada was incredible!!!! I had a burrito with rice, beans, cheese, asada and some salsa and onions with cilantro. I want more today!!!!! The only thing I found to be "ok.." was that the asada is really salty. But I love salty! YUM!!!!!
ruuGQ-ceB7MBX7bdD39H9Q : I purchased a Nikon D40 at Tall's in October 07 and a 55-200mm VR lens in November 2007.  I first went to the Bellevue Square store and asked to buy a D40 - they were out of stock of the D40 (but had the D40x, which I didn't want). The sales associate called the U-District store and had them hold one for me.  Drove across the lake to the U-District store and went up to the counter and stated that I wanted to buy a Nikon D40 (and I had one on hold) and slapped my credit card down. While I had researched the camera on the internet and had made my decision, the sales clerk insisted on having me shoot a few shots with their demo D40 to make sure I liked the handling of the camera.  A month later, I went back to Tall's after a day at Woodland Park Zoo, in which I decided I wanted a telephoto zoom lens. Was interested in the Nikon 55-200mm VR, and the sales associate put the lens on a demo D40 and let me take a number of shots in the store to see how the lens handled and how image stabilization worked in low light.  While Tall's isn't perfect (there's always the customer who knows nothing about photography except what they read in the latest issue of CR and hogs the sales staff) they're a decent local store, and one that I'd rather deal with in place of an online retailer (or the awful Kits/Ritz Camera empire).
9ByccUVZThlPc8ipjrgqpw : BF chose the place. Quick service, however, we were the only customers. Rolls were big but not too tasty. Had a weird feeling in my stomach.   Ordered their Blue Crunch, G's roll, and Red Crunch off their "special" $7.99 deal. The Blue and Red Crunch roll had really thin slices of fish on top (Blue - salmon; Red - tuna). The G's roll had cooked spicy tuna that tasted overdue. They all had a tangy taste to it; don't know if that's the purpose or the fish weren't fresh.   Host was also the chef and the server.   Not coming here again. I feel bad for this place.
WVQxrBdwD1V-5C2uZAFNXA : This place is so hit or miss.  I've had some great wraps here when they first opened.  But lately it's been just plain disgusting.  Do not look very closely at the restaurant (walls, floor, decor) because it is dingy and dirty and you may lose your appetite.  The mashed potatoes have been served cold every time I've had them.  The mexi-slaw is usually good though.  And the wraps just depend on who is cooking that day as to what you will get.  The outdoor area is nice when the weather cooperates in the Burg.  The service is horrible just like almost every restaurant in the area.  Yes, they do have a decent selection of tequilas if that is what you are looking for.  But as far as food, I would go somewhere else.
LWpA89lhZ5hylijTA0aYIQ : 12.05.07: Its really tough to get me upset or disappointed, but this place seem to have accomplished that exactly. Walked in and was greeted and seated immediately. The tables were so close together it was a little annoying. People who sat next to me can literally just share food with me. Mine as well. It was not crowded or busy just good amount of people sitting too close to each other.  The waiter had the craziest accent ever. It was really hard to understand him, I had him repeat the specials twice. He told the specials to two tables at a time. I mean he had to. We were so close that it was almost as if everyone was one big table.  Of course bread was given to us by our waiter, and it was horrible. It was hard as rock. We saw other tables get bread as well but it looked really soft. So we ordered another basket of bread with someone else and they brought us nice soft warm bread. I think this waiter hate us. Its like he doesn't care. I ordered the steak dish on the special. I also ordered the pinot grigio. The wine was great. The steak dish was not steak. It tasted like fish. It was soft like fish and it has no steak taste to it. Yes it was smothered with some cream sauce and mushroom but no steak in there. Just tasted like fish and mushrooms. I was very disappointed with my dish. So I didn't eat it.  The waiter came by and he try to take my dish away to get me something else. I told him I didn't want anything else and its okay cause I already lost my appetite. He grab my plate and I told him to leave it. He kept on insisting and he end up yelling at me. Whoa! I seriously was gonna slap him in the face. ASSHOLE! It was really intense argument. He walked away and said well I don't know what you want. HELLLLOOO you freaking idiot I just said leave me alone I don't want anything else. Did I f*ckin stutter? Well of course that was all said in my head. What a dumass. I came with my good friend Lily and she was upset too. Her dish was not good at all. Both disappointed we decided that you can't go wrong with dessert. So we were right. Dessert it was. I got the molton chocolate cake. It was freaking good. So one star for that. That's it. Nothing else was good. I forgot his name..damn that stupid waiter.
TWMNEkBZq9VALm1TOkL46w : Almost an oasis between the two Middle East clubs this is a surprisingly low key, fun eatery. Local artists adorn the walls (usually very good, for a change) a small bar where you never have trouble being waited on and good food.  You can get typical Middle Eastern fare with Falafal, lamb kebobs, etcs, but, believe it or not-- they have a really good burger and fries.  Seeing a paticularly long show at the Middle East? Skip one of the crappy bands and go upstairs for a decently priced meal.
Ed-9vd3iM6hVDrZmBSh-KA : A hidden treasure of music, movies and books in the U District. From the outside, this place doesn't look like much, but head downstairs and you'll find yourself lost in one of Seattle's better indie music shops. David owns the place, and is genuinely interested in making sure his customers are happy. He's also extremely knowledgeable when it comes to the music he sells.  Seattle has a large number of amazing independent music stores, but this one is definitely near the top of my list overall.
cGfdBhLBr896oN96q11NJA : Eno Terra is great. The menu is seasonal and there are often at least 4 additions to the menu each night (appetizers, entrees). The fried artichoke appetizer is delicious, and the pastas, while on the higher price end, are large and fantastic.   The complaint about the valet is worthwhile, but you don't have to accept to service. Just tell them you'd rather park your own car and they're happy to let you do it. If that's your big complaint, you've got a lotta problems.
FzB2M0SZfAHrSld73H61lA : This is a very small library compared to the other branches.  It is much newer and feels cleaner but if you're looking for a place to hang out or look for books, I would suggest trying any other branch.  The children's section is half of the second floor while the adults and teens share the other half.  The librarians upstairs can be super helpful or outright rude, depends on your luck. The movies are located on the first floor as well a computer room for adults (children's computers are upstairs in their section).  I use this branch for picking up books when I stop at the Columbia farmer's market on Thursdays during their season.  There is a self-checkout machine if you don't want wait for service.  But, if you are picking up a requested movie, you have to wait for them to find it behind the counter.
d56zmgVqICbR03a87O7C6A : Came here to check out the brunch menu...ordered the croissant french toast with a side of bacon ($8.50). An order comes with three huge pieces the size of my head. My head is gigantic. Great texture and buttery taste from the croissant. The fresh strawberries and bananas on top was a great touch. The bacon is need for a balance of sweet and savory, nonetheless, bacon goes with EVERYTHING!  I took a bite of my brother's crab cake eggs benedict and it was just ok. My expectations were too high on the crab cake. The majority was mainly breadcrumbs and other fillers and very little crab. But I guess for only $12 a plate one can't expect more than that. The breakfast flat bread pizza ($8) was pretty good. The crust was as thin as a cracker and topped with eggs, tomatoes, cheese and bacon. Good option for those who are carb-conscious.   The real star of the meal....The Hungry's Sampler ($8). What a tasty array of hummus, couscous, and pureed eggplant dip, served with pita bread. Watch out Niko Nikos...this appetizer is worth ruining your appetite. The spices pack so much punch and the consistency of the dips were just perfect. Will be back just for this!
d6gnfwfkP1w6p8ArqCLPwQ : Overproduced, too-slick radio wears on a person after a while. Perhaps it's the shouting DJ's, commercials with volume would up several thousand decibels beyond the earsplitting range, or the repetitive playlists. Or maybe it's just that they play crap.  On the other hand...there is a beautiful aural oasis located at a bit down the dial at 95.3. It's called WHRB and in today's radio world it seems to do everything wrong. It plays jazz in the morning - not commercial cool jazz but the real stuff, the Ramsey Lewis, Sonny Stitt and age-old Louis Armstrong material, along with some fun Maynard Ferguson for variety. It's on all morning without commercial interruptions or quick cuts from one segment to another. Late mornings and early afternoons have the kind of classical selections not found anywhere, except in a music library or fine record store. Later in the evenings there's alternative and new wave stuff that makes a listener just go 'wow.'   I'm a big fan of HRB on the weekends too. It serves the Harvard community well, with Crimson football in the fall and services from Memorial Church on Sundays. I'm a particular fan of Saturday morning's "Hillbilly at Harvard," show, featuring real country music, not the "hat show," tunes favored by commercial country stations. All the way around WHRB is a very different station, different in a very positive, listenable way. The DJ's are knowledgeable about what they're playing and cater to a deeper interest in music among their listeners - they know their subjects and never insult the mentality or taste of their audience.  One or two stations in the area might have a program that rivals one of HRB's presentations. However...top to bottom WHRB is the best listening experience in Boston. Professional, not slick. Not loud, but proud.
XFIsqpBT8tGpqekRUmCK0A : I could tell Top Dog is definitely a local favorite. It was about 11 at night, and this place was swarming with bunch of college students.  GREAT bockwursts just for a couple of bucks.. really yummy.  I also enjoyed the really funny anti-capitalist stickers all over the wall.  Minus one star because the guy kept on forgetting my order, but it was understandable because the place was FILLED with people, I guess.
gGCZaIE2X_0DrpJql2O5PA : yum!!! huge portions, delicious and fair prices. you will leave full and happy. not a grease pit either.
COv1G3-t-IE0UweBQdVvUQ : This travel agency is the worst I have ever encountered in my life!  My youngest daughter planned a trip with STA to Spain for a month through UCLA.   To make a long story short.  She missed her flight due to a family emergency ( her grandfather was diagnosed with 2 weeks to live - leukemia).  The travel agent NEVER told us that my daughters flights were cancelled - both the flight there and also the return.  When trying to find another flight ERIN, the employee of STA was extremely rude and unaccommodating.  EXCUSE ME for putting money in your company's business.  In this wonderful world of the internet, we could be booking our own flights which we ended up doing in the end.  Isn't that supposed to be the perk of using a travel agent?  SERVICE?  At least good service?  You weren't even decent!   Erin told us that we lost our money - this is the norm for the airlines that was originally booked - well that was HER explanation.  My husband called the airlines himself and got our money back.  Can you imagine that?  All it took was a phone call.  I mean isn't that in the realm of being a travel agent? ERIN was extremely rude to both my husband and myself.   She cancelled the return flight on us so we had to find my daughter's own flight back - it was either that or have our 20 yr old daughter be stuck in Spain.   STA markets CHEAP flights, well, sometimes a cheap flight = cheap service.  I'd rather pay $1500 more and get service and reliability - essential for traveling out of the country.   Thank you Erin, for your lack of judgement on a young girl's travel out of the country.  Thank you Erin, for being rude and not giving a crap about your customers. Thank you Erin for representing STA travel in such a horrible way.  You're lucky I'm not your boss, you'd be fired in a heartbeat for treating customers as you do and then I'd put you on prozac because you must be very unhappy to treat people so bad.   Poor girl.  Do yourself a favor and quit your job.  Find something you love because you obviously don't enjoy what you are doing. This company gets 5 foots up the ass for not keeping tabs on their employees.
1x_t1ZkBBp2B4C_3WLsLkQ : There are two ways to look at this place, one is to judge it based on the quality of the food (not so great), and the other is by the price (great for the area). Value is where these two factors merge and where individual taste emerges.  Flat Patties is a fast food place in every sense of the word, and whether or not you like it is dependent on your tolerance (or love of) your standard fast food. In every way, Flat Patties is much better than your typical chain fast food place - but it is unabashedly still fast food. And foodies beware this is food for convenience and price nothing more.  I personally have a very low tolerance for Fast Food and found myself significantly less enamored with Flat Patties than my companions who have taken me. The buttered brioche buns are a fabulous touch, but it is the greasy low-quality beef that fails to excite me, the cursory not-always-fresh toppings, and the unimpressively average fries that fails to impress. Sure it's better than Burger King, McDonald's, and Wendy's but not much more.  For the price, you'll struggle to find a better deal in Harvard Square.  Pinnocchio's is the only alternative that comes to mind (and is a better option, IMHO). Personally, I'll save up my bad karma from meat-eating for something a bit higher quality.
o3_eFnSncBBjPFEHW30S6Q : When I'm at Stanford with my family, I just say I'm hungry and it's already given that we're going to La Baguette. I've eaten almost all the savory things here. The baguettes, sandwiches, salads, and even pizzas. Talk about delicious! The Margarita sandwich is so fresh and healthy. Chinsse chicken salad is the one I tried recently and it's my new favorite. It's light, flavorful, and filling and it's made to order so it's fresh, as well. You can never go wrong with a baguette. And the pizza is what I order when I'm realllyyy hungry! I never really liked the mango mousse, however. I bring my own drink or buy it somewhere else because it's really expensive. Yeah, everything there is pretty high in price but I think it's all yummy. Expect a long but somewhat fast line outside. Shouldn't be too much of a problem most of the time. Overall, La Baguette is a great place to go to recharge before hitting the shops again.
qD2EoX7Qwra1xsmuTOVyWA : Loved it! Right down the street from my friends doorm and right next to JP Licks. A definite genius spot. Pretty sure I got the Condolezza Rice (or some type of famous woman) veggie burger and it was so tasty! Voted number one burgers in America? Is that possible? YES! The fries were crispy and the burger was juicy. Will put in top spot next to in n out.
BFS9io1bj9PQC_Dm7se7FQ : No Thai! is good for something slightly different for lunch, its fast (kinda americanized) Thai style dishes. There are fairly few tables so its not great to go with a large groups, but with 4 or less people its usually doable. Portions are quite large so you might have some left over for a snack or tomorrows lunch. My favorites are the Pad Thai and Drunken noodles, and I like selecting the tofu as my protein, because its usually well prepared, but the beef and shrimp are good too.
lQTUfc2SJgf6Z0lJg2FxIA : The cheapest place to buy bread or hostess bake goods in town!  There's only one reason I come here and it's to buy bread. I don't eat Twinkies, fruit pies or any other of those homogenized factory made bake goods that shaped Ian W's youth(previous reviewer).  This place is awesome for one reason, you can buy 79 cent loafs of bread. Not just any old bread either, you can get the organic stuff like Nature's pride which is usually about $3.50 a loaf. The bread is past or near it's due date and can/will mold up in about a week or two. If you are planning on stocking up, use of a freezer will be necessary. (There is half price bread that is $1.50 that is further from it's due date, as well)  A word of caution, if the manager (boisterous dark haired women) is working she probably won't let you leave without trying to sell you a ton of those hostess baked goods I mentioned earlier. Just politely say 'no thanks' about 10 times and eventually she'll just give you a box of something for free (I bring em' to work; office co-workers seem love em').   If I liked the baked goods I would probably love this place even more. You can buy whole boxes of the stuff for 50 cents or less!!  The last time I was in here, I got two loafs of bread for free! The total cost of 6 loafs was $2.99!! The feeling I got riding home with all that bread was sooo amazing, I wanted to hug the world...thus leading me to write this 5 star review.
OTPVjlCNsUpUWSt2FI5R1w : The most disgusting restaraunt in the Columbia area. DON'T DO IT. I asked the waiter if he had vegetarian tiki masala and he said "yes but it's not on the menu." I ordered that and naan. What came out was a yellow sauce that smelled like vomit. I told him this is not tiki masala and he kept calling it some name and I said but that's not tiki masala . He understood but they are so cheap and short-sighted he didn't want to even try to take the vomit back.  So I decided to try it because I was quite hungry and boy was that a mistake , it was horrendous. I had to sanitize my mouth since. So I decided to eat the naan. This is not naan, guarantee they do not have a naan oven there. It was old bread that they put tons of butter on and microwaved. I mean really. And it smelled like hell too. I have never left my entire order at a restaraunt, EVER. He not only didn't give a damn , he charged me for the whole order then blocked my path while he scrutinized my signature on the receipt! I had to say excuse me for him to move so I could leave! He has no shame. If you want Indian there is a place at about 108th and broadway that is pretty good, def above average. Do not go to this dump, it's pure trash .
m_1xK_SK91C_dQwh_bgQ7Q : This is my favorite froyo place in Ann Arbor by far. Note that it is not a self-serve place which I actually prefer. Price is based on pre-set cup sizes (and number of toppings) rather than by the ounce. This is much better, for me, in terms of controlling portions because when I try to measure my own portions, I inevitably get too much.  The froyo actually tastes very much like yogurt - super tart and creamy. It's by far much better than Amer's or any place other in Ann Arbor. It tasted authentic and like it has nutritional value.  There's also a girl there with curly blond hair who is super sweet and really helpful. On a hot summer day or on a humid night after dinner, I like to go there and sit on their nice comfortable leather couches and watch their 3 flat-screen TVs. The music there is a bit tacky. They also need to take down their handwritten signs and make formal signs if they want to up their ambiance a bit. Also note that the hours of operation on the door are incorrect. But overall, I give it 5 stars just because the yogurt there is delicious and I always have great customer service from the girl with the curly blond hair.
s0eze1euX7uyj0Nr0fVY4g : 2 stars for service, 5 stars for food.   I came here on a Thursday night (7/21/11) at around 9pm, and was sorely disappointed with the service. I'm all for employees having fun and enjoying themselves, but the girls that were working seemed to be more interested in dancing to the music than helping customers. The music was WAY too loud (maybe I just really dislike loud Mexican music?), and I felt like I had to scream my order just to be heard. It seemed to me that the line outside kept growing not because more people were coming in, but because the two girls would dance, scoop, dance, scoop, change music, dance, scoop. Seriously, I just wanted to buy and eat my ice cream sandwich, not watch a Broadway show about scooping ice cream.   That being said, I was helped by the only guy there that seemed to actually be working, and I loved my ice cream sandwich.
WUIafYMw60_dDLZEcuUzvg : This is a place located in a cafeteria style building near USC and only casue I didn't want to eat Mo-Chica I came here.  I had the Huevos Rancheros cause I was craving breakfast, my friend got the Chicharron tacos and my other friend got the Cochinita Pibil.   I didn't try the tacos but the Cochinita was fucking amazing. And so was my dish.  They have 2 different types of salsas and OMG i think it's just as good as King Taco's hot sauce.  If you can handle spicy, you'll love it.  I ate it about 24 hours ago and my stomach is still messed up from it.  now that's some great salsa!  The green one is better fyi.  I don't usually like cafeteria style, but this place didn't make me carry my own food, they brought it out to us.  Less work for me!
Xn0_r4lLVl20Rx95I44vvg : I have no idea how this place got an A rating.  If I wrote this review a couple months ago, I'd probably give it 3-4 stars, the food was pretty good, the price was pretty good, overall, everything was pretty good. But I didn't write this review a couple months ago.  Basically, I've gotten kind of sick the last couple times I've come here, I'm not going to go into detail, but I'm sure you can guess how someone gets sick from a restaurant. I don't know what happened, but both times I got sick I noticed something was kind of off with the food.   Oh well, needless to say, I won't be coming back here again.
im-o7H0syUz_dsG0r3RgFg : The food is decent here... that is, if you ever get it. I visited Mellow Mushroom on the drag for the first time yesterday and I will never return.  Upon arriving, the restaurant was less than half full. My group of four was not greeted upon entry, so we seated ourselves. A waiter came over fairly quickly and got our drinks and took our order. When the drinks arrived, the soda was flat, so we alerted him to the problem. He said he'd check it out, left, and didn't return for almost 10 minutes. He then replied that the soda was fine and didn't even offer to get us new drinks or replace them with something else. We decided to drink water.  Two member of our group order beers, but the waiter never returned, so in order to get refills they had to go to the bar themselves. We were talking amongst ourselves, so the time went quickly at first, but after about 30 minutes we went and found the waiter to ask him what the delay was. He said it would only be five more minutes.  Another 15 minutes goes by and still nothing, so we go ask for the manager. She comes out and tells us that the wait has "only" been 42 minutes and that since their food is made-to-order that it takes longer and certain pizzas take awhile to make, etc, etc. She even made excuses for our slack waiter. Correct me if I'm wrong, but almost every restaurant in America is MADE WHEN YOU ORDER. This is not a new concept. Additionally, I've never been to a pizza joint where it took 45 minutes to bake a pizza.  After disregarding our complaints, the manager left to go check on our order. I wanted to just leave, but my friends suggested that we just wait it out. Another 10 minutes later and the food finally arrived. A total, according to the restaurant, of 56 minutes from order time to delivery. Absurd.  The food was decent, the service terrible, and the manager dismissive. They even charged us for the flat drinks. The manager made a "grand gesture" and comped our beers. Big whoop. I will not be returning.
aEY8mboT7JM683a7NfUljg : Great staff! Everyone is friendly and helpful! :) The interior is great for something around State street or campus. More like what you would expect out of Main Street and the nicer places.   Prices are def reasonable with appetizers such as the 2 pork belly buns for $6, spring rolls, edamame, etc.  There are ramen, udon, PHO!!!! WHICH I CAN"T WAIT TO TRY THE PHO since there isn't any good Pho around Ann Arbor. So yea..everyone recommends the pork belly buns! I took some pics and will post them later. They are great...amazingly cooked, not heavy, sauce was just right. Reminded me of the Peking duck wraps I use to eat in Boston (why aren't there any around here?).   I'd def go on a date here, have dinner with friends, or sit at the bar and just enjoy the atmosphere. The place is pretty spacey so you aren't sitting on top of people. The furniture and artsy feeling makes it very appealing. Also the art work is great on the side of when the place was being built. There is also a huge flat screen tv over the bar so we were just sitting there catching up on the news.  CHECK IT OUT! It just opened today 4/16/2010 :)
mquEOh-pWbTcxoLfDxzADg : This is definitely one of the more pretentious places in town, more so regarding the clientele than the store itself per se. I appreciate that it's nice to have alternatives to Starbucks, of course, and Small World definitely serves that purpose well. But there has always been something about this place that I didn't like too much, although I've had trouble putting my finger on it. The prices are not particularly reasonable, but then again, they don't tend to be at coffee shops so I guess that's not too unique to this place. The food is mediocre at best, I don't think I've ever had anything here that left a positive impression.  If you're visiting town and want some coffee, you might as well skip Starbucks on Nassau St and head over here just to experience something a bit different. But don't expect to find any seating since tons of people come here to spend the day or to meet up with others.
cEi0BvcmFQNRUj8fLTT61g : If I could give it zero stars I would!!!! Worst customer service I have ever had to deal with! I will never stay at another choice hotel!
ukpDkZN3z-qsh4K9FJQPrA : A classic. The only place in Berkeley that is open after midnight (In a college town?? WTF?) grilled dogs not boiled which is a bit of a let down but they do have kosher dogs and Sauerkraut. When I'm up late hacking code, A couple of Top Dogs really hit the spot.
J5CYbL2pZvDDbRe3rZrd5Q : Sorry... not sure how anyone can give these cupcakes 5 stars but when your lease is up on that rock you live under, get out and try some GREAT cupcakes elsewhere. The frosting is good, but the cake is NOT. :(
4BVhH2demRQsq47hv4tmHQ : Cheap, huge portions, and their pad thai was darn satisfying.  Not high-end Thai food, but it kept me going during college.
pFLNwjA5LrGpSY807TqFXw : It's all about the atmosphere at Dadealus.  We went last night, on a slightly chilly late-spring evening.  The upstairs was packed with Harvard Business School students having a celebratory end-of-semester drink.   They were in small groups talking loudly, happily. The doors were open, the room was dimly lit showcasing the deep red walls, the music was good (Curtis Mayfield, James Brown).  For a minute, I forgot I was on Mt. Auburn Street in Harvard Square.  The atmosphere is that good.  The atmosphere is good enough that you almost forget about the food, which is startlingly mediocre.  I had the special salad- spinach, roasted corn, roma tomatoes, shrimp, goat cheese, and a citrus dressing.  The special salad was 90% spinach, three small pieces of tomato, a few pieces of corn, and an uninspired dressing.  For $14.95, it felt like a big rip off.  My boyfriend ordered the blackened halibut which was served with a fruity salsa and some rice.  It lacked the most basic ingredient - salt - and the entire meal was very, very dry.  The fish was over-cooked, the salsa lacked the wetness that salsa is supposed to have (it was just some chopped-up, not-yet-ripe fruit) and the rice was less-than-exciting.    My advice: go for a drink.
zwn19Fj3qsV5bXmoD_-Bgg : Wow. Trust me when I tell you this place is wonderful.  I made a catering order for my boyfriend's 30th birthday party... without ever eating at this restaurant before. A friend of mine raved about this place plenty of times, I trusted her and thought Yucatan style Mexican food would be a nice change of pace for our dinner party.  I tried the food about 2 weeks before the party after I had already confirmed my order. I trusted my friends word about the food, and of course, trusted my fellow yelpers. And it was better than I had expected! I ordered the chicken pibil (which I also ordered for the party) and it was delicious. Super duper (duper)  tender meat, awesome sauce, yummy black beans.... it was goooood. I was even more confident about my catering order. Yeah! I was happy.  They were super helpful throughout the entire catering estimate process, I was able to do nearly everything online. The food was ready on time for pick up. They gave me PLENTY. I had so much food, it was great. People loved it! I loved it! And most importantly, the birthday boy loved it!   As a side note: both times I visited their restaurant (well, it's more like a food stand kinda thing inside Mercado La Paloma) it was packed with people. I went the first time about 5 minutes before closing and there were lots of folks hanging around.   Go! You won't be disappointed. Promise.
UEIvKHnrE3Sar1gVHSiufQ : I thought there wasn't a convenient supermarket around Central and Kendall until i discovered this little gem. I used to drive all the way out to Porter or Twin City Plaza, but this is literally a 15 second walk from work. Its a little hard to notice (ok, there is a large "star market" sign outside, but besides that...) because its the second floor of a hotel, and there's no outside parking.  However, there is a parking garage, and as long as you spend $10 inside, they'll validate your ticket at the register.   Inside is much larger than you'd expect. They have everything I need, and more, including a large section by the deli and produce where they have huge party platters and meals and stuff.   The other thing that makes this a fun store is that it's by MIT, so you get lots of guys whizzing down the isles on Rollerblades (watch out or they'll clip you while you're bending down looking for your favorite Goya brand juice.  The BEST part is- the self check-out is quick and there is rarely a line at any register.
Sv_Kx5iMHDzbBKGG6dLBZA : I grew up with Winchell's donuts, and they've been good elsewhere, but I've tried this location on South Lake a few times and have been disappointed each time. If I'm going to eat something unhealthy I want to enjoy eating it, but there's no pleasure to be had here, just donuts that are stale and taste bad. Don't waste your time, money, and taste buds with this place.
bhv_m7eaCzc2B_hRSKNdQw : Went for $1 domestics on Tuesday. Definitely have had better service. Mostly a college crowd.
ypK-AdOrouQwHszyoAwfWw : for all those cal students, this is the place where you can get those mocha biancas to die for.  i havent been back in a long time, but this weekend went for a quick stop and an espresso.  i guess your taste does change when you get older because i dont think i've ever ordered an espresso from there.  this is what an espresso is like!  forget about any other coffee place, big corporation or mom and pop.  this double espresso looked like it came from the all you can drink fountain at the burger shop.  it was so huge, i had to let some of it go, and i've NEVER done that.   go get some, and get your study on, or whatever you can do bouncing off the walls with a double x double espresso!
y47SI1KUHXEWlNICp8wBYQ : Mr. Bartley's Burger Cottages is an experience one must have when visiting Harvard Square.  I really enjoyed the burger I ordered. I had a Condoleeza Rice burger which is basically a bacon cheeseburger. The burgers were HUGE! I would recommend ordering the burger more well done than you normally do as mine seemed slightly under cooked.   A friend of mine hyped up the sweet potato fries and said they were amazing but I wasn't as impressed. My boyfriend makes super good sweet potato fries so they had a lot to live up to, and they didn't make the cut. I also like mine to actually be sweet which there's weren't.  Another thing that was strange for me. It is so small and cramped that anyone could become anxious. It also didn't seem like they even had a bathroom..I don't know where they would put one if they did!  Note to Bartley's: People don't like sweet potato fries with ketchup, it tastes weird. You should offer honey mustard instead. Its yummy.
cI-osxEHN51PiGZ4OMANRQ : First off, let me admit to not being a fan of Mexican food. Even though I grew up a stone's throw away from East L.A. my palate never quite acquiesced to the floury taste of tortilla, the staple of Mexican cuisine. As a kid I would cringe every time I found out the cafeteria was serving burritos. Burrito days at school left me with no other option but to skillfully suck my burrito dry with a plastic straw, leaving the deflated tortilla wrap behind. Sad, I know. My sidekick, Jo, on the other hand LOVES Mexican food. I stumbled upon a food blog dedicated to finding great taco digs in and around Los Angeles. The Great Taco Hunt  posted their best finds of 2006 and La Taquiza was voted best place to get carne asada tacos. I half-heartedly mentioned to Jo that we should drop in and try it out-and just like that we were in the car and headed to La Taquiza before I could finish my suggestion.  Situated a couple of blocks from the University of Spoiled Children (Bruin alum here), La Taquiza sits snugly in the corner of a shopping plaza. The crowd at the taqueria consisted mostly of Hispanics (always a good sign of authenticity) with the occasional maroon and gold-cladded student dropping in for what I'm sure was breakfast for them (~1 pm on a Sat.). I admit, I felt a bit apprehensive when we entered. I don't know if it was the thought of eating tortilla (freshly made from scratch here) or maybe it was the group vato locos that shot me a glare when I entered the joint, like I stepped foot into their territory. Jo noticed my uneasiness and asked me what was wrong, but before I could answer, she began to list all the things she wanted to order.  The ordering system at La Taquiza works in what I think is a confusing manner. You tell the cook what you want and then move on to repeat your order to the cashier. You then wait for your items to be called, which come out in increments and might be difficult to follow if you ordered an array of items.  The salsa bar had an array of salsas that you can dress your tacos, burritos, etc. with. They also had pickled jalepenos, pickled carrots and fresh sliced beats to munch on if your mouth gets overheated by any of the salsas.  I must confess that I took a liking to the tacos here. The carne asada taco was good, although I really have no benchmark to compare it to. Jo thought it was a too salty and said it was leagues behind King Taco, the Mexican temple of choice for Jo to pay her respects to the Taco God. The taco al pastor, layered marinated slices of pork compressed tightly and roasted on a vertical spit, was a bit salty. The tacos I enjoyed most were the shrimp (del carbon) and the fish taco. The liquidy sour cream mixed with guacamole and topped off with a bit of salsa verde complimented the deep fried fish very nicely.  What about the tortilla, you ask? Well, La Taquiza's made from scratch tortilla is not like the average stain-repellent brand you find at your local supermarket, where any excess liquid will run off and drip out the side of your taco. The tortilla at La Taquiza is more absorbant, the Bounty Extra Strength of tortillas, leaving the sauces to seep into the tortilla and inject it with flavor. It was "aight" and that's just about all you will get out of me.  Thanks to La Taquiza, I now no longer dread my next visit to a Mexican restaurant. This doesn't mean that I'm gonna rush out and stock up on frijoles, just that I will no longer throw a fit if Jo or any of my other dining mates suggest a Mexican place to eat at.
a_TGYBx4a23jMpY5hiGDqg : Very fresh, tasty pizza.  I hate communal seating and "mingling", so I opted for one of the stools along the small wall counters.  I got a little nervous when I sat down, because each stool has a note taped on the seat that reads "Do not move this stool or you'll be asked to leave".  Hmmm...can it move it to sit down?  Is it here for decoration only?  I decided it just meant I could not move it to another table - few that there are.  My $21 San Gennaro pizza arrived quickly.  The huge pan it is served on barely fit the counter and took up two spaces.  I ended up having to stand and eat, hunched over the pan.  I don't mind things like this.  It was piping hot and a nice party in my mouth.  Nicely flavored italian sausage hunks, tasty sweet cherry peppers, tangy sauce & buffalo mozzarella melding together on a somewhat crispy/somewhat limpy crust.  You must eat with both hands once beginning a new piece.  I tossed it all back with a $2.25 aluminum bottle of coke (they have a refrigerator with cokes, water, and Italian sodas).  There are no condiments on the counter seats.  Just a roll of brown paper for "napkins".  I think i did spot some olive oil, garlic & parmesean on one of the big tables.  All-in-all, a pleasant experience.  I wasn't blown away like lots of folks, but still enjoyed it, and may go back with friends.  The cannoli looked great, and I'd like to try on the next visit.  Will be interested to see how the leftovers reheat tonight....I hope my oven will help crisp up the crust.
xg_cPsaFyhpU4bJW6XC_FQ : good enough, cheap clothes. plus cal stuff. (i'll even admit it, i have a cal sweatshirt. but i went to cal, it's my right. & anyway, i'd never ever wear it out of the house. god.) plus a selection of good, cheap shoes upstairs. awesome and yet, not awesome. i've spent way too much money on shoes here over the years.  photobooth out front!!
DVKSOzPMS24_xcirnIgDlQ : This was one of my favorite haunts. But I must sadly report that it is no longer in operation. The owner had a large sale and the store closed. They did have an increasing selection of cigarettes and the owner would order cartons of whatever you wanted pretty cheap. The cigar selection was also fantastic as well as the pipe tobacco and they had very nice quality pipes. The owner was so friendly too. RIP Claremont Tobacco House
P5s0mFhha2H3Ky0A7WZ_mQ : Northside diversifies the standard breakfast menu with Huevos and a Breakfast Burrito - me being from Colorado am very very appreciative.  Here's a suggestion - biscuits and gravy!  Now I know they don't serve that here in the Midwest, but please, Northside, make it a consideration.  And thank you for giving us this super hot waiter with a wonderfully deep voice - it made my mom happy.  We also liked the plethora of pancake options and omletes - and fresh squeezed O.J.  As other reviewers have said, this place hearkens back to the olde days before Atkins, before Lipitor, when a well-balanced diet was the way to go.
HoI2mwFHYCFiOM4TZ-YPZw : If you've ever had a craving for chinese take out, then you will understand why I eat at Pu Pu Hot Pot.  It's also very possible that I keep coming back because somewhere deep inside my diligently composed twenty something exterior, there is a completely immature eight year old that laughs at the idea of me enjoying my Pu Pu Hot Pot meal.  Seriously though -- this place satisfies everthing I've come to expect from chinese take out.  Nothing more, nothing less.
JWfyt_LSY_Vtbbt0Y_Utzg : I love getting tea from here. They have the earl greyer, which is a slightly more bergamot infused version of the original. Also fantastic is their Apple Blossom Green Tea.  The only thing I find awkward is trying to get over to the sugar/milk/lids station, since one has to walk through the seating area to get there. It would make more sense if it were connected to the counter where drinks are picked up at.  They have really great baked goods, and if you go in at night, you can find the days leftovers for half off. It's a good place to hang out, and they have wireless which is nice for people who want to do some studying and chill for awhile.  All in all, much better than Starbucks, because it's local and cooler.  I haven't tried their coffee, so I don't know how it stacks up. The staff are always super nice and friendly.
qqiJ7oR-jtWP9M6soQtz_A : I came here for a lunch with my boss on a walk back to the office post-meeting. Luckily he had about two hours until his next meeting--and he needed it! They are definitely ironing out a lot of kinks here and it took almost two hours.   I walked in--I'd never set foot in Baja Fresh--and the set up is nice and fairly fancy for a Drag restaurant with a nice wood carved bench, open seating, and an awesome dragon mosaic. I envisioned myself 10 years prior picking through 99 cent records near the vicinity of the kitchen and got a pang of nostalgia (the former incarnation was also where I discovered Daniel Johnson--now only his mural peeks through on the side--when they used to sell his cassette tapes at the counter, but I digress.)  Service was sloooow and pretty awful. We ordered some egg rolls and they took forever, luckily, because placing our order took forever, too, and I was starving. The waiter seemed pretty out of it, and I had to struggle to get his attention a couple of times.   I got the garlic pork with rice and cucumbers. Only there were no cucumbers. And the meat was a little yucky and gristly, and it was in this kind of icky gravy concoction, which was not at all what I was expecting. My boss got peanut chicken, which appeared--and he confirmed--was very peanutty.   One of the employees spilled water right by me, then didn't bother to even clean it up, which kind of stunned me. I got up to use the restroom, and there was water all from our table to the kitchen, and I tried really hard not to slip in it. I regret not insisting they clean it up, because while waiting (and waiting) for the check, a waitress came walking by and fell so hard on her rear, that it was painful to watch (the kind of "thwap!" that made me think "donut pillow.") Poor thing.   Yeah, here's hoping that they get their act together. I can't say if I'd give them another shot, even though I love sushi.   When I got back, my coworkers asked for a review. My review was simply, "Can these people not freaking mop!?" Enough said.
o08M_gYf7j3oqzlRQWKRfA : Mrs. Cook's is a good place to go to support an independent shop that may carry something different that WS.  The staff has always been helpful for me and can point me to exactly what I was looking for.  Make sure you understand the return policy for things that you buy there as once we bought a scale that broke and they wouldn't replace it.  A little frustrating for us as I think other stores would have taken an exchange.
3m3uiH48AZapCi5dHhaQGA : Like an idiot, I booked a 6 am flight for Thanksgiving day.  "It's so cheap!" ... "wait, the T won't be running yet".  Lesson learned.  Having Googled Boston-area cab companies, PlanetTran came up, and I noticed that their Twitter feed had a 50% off coupon (for first-time bookers, I think).  The $70 flat rate from Brookline to Logan was knocked down to an affordable $35, and I was able to pay for and reserve my ride online, confirming my pickup time and address.  The driver (in a snappy looking suit) was early for my 4:00 am pickup, and the car was impeccable.  Just a fantastic experience.  (The website says that tipping isn't required, but I couldn't help but give my driver something...even though in no way did I feel pressured to tip).  I'll probably never use them unless I can get similar discounts, because $70 to go to the airport (from Brookline) is just not in my budget, but if any of you out there regularly take car services or have expense accounts, do yourselves a favor and check out PlanetTran.
raC1gr1Wyj0qH_O4zX9CmQ : I'm with "shark teeth"- Dr. Brunick is a great dentist.  And I've also had multiple teeth cleanings in his office from the fabulous Darlene. :)  I thought root canals were supposed to be painful... so I dreaded getting one inevitably for a tooth that had a super-shallow root.  I thought they were supposed to be super-painful, but I came away feeling like it had just been another day at the dentist.
Ns35ZstdEk1dhZtEo_ir4g : I severely dislike BBQ, but this place is so AMAZING! It is one of my favorite restaurants of all time. I would eat here everyday. The homemade sauces are to die for, their sweet tea is delicious, their lemonade is spectacular, and the pulled pork is rivaled by none. This is the place right here!
2h5zAsEylaH-j0ZwK1eMsg : Better quality food than Naan 'n Curry! It's also got a better atmosphere.
5RW6IrabVrjhwAvsOHf-gw : What a disappointment!  After reading those other reviews, although rather outdated, we were excited to try this neighborhood Italian for its pizza and salad.  The waiter didn't know much of anything about the menu or ingredients, and was annoyed by the prospect of having to ask the manager-- even though the place was almost empty.  He was  down right rude, but the manager is lovely.  The salad was not fresh, and had no flavor, and the dressing too much vinegar.  The real problem was the burned crust pizza.  It may have tasted better had it not been blackened pizza, but we will never know.  I will say the sausage was quite good.  We  showed  three waiters and the  manager  that the pizza was inedible due to its burnt  state.  They shrugged and walked away.  As did we, never to return; we suggest  you do the same.
9n7D5GkzbWYA6CqR4OOIhw : I had heard so many great things about this place, so I was super excited to try it for the first time.   We ordered the salt and pepper tofu for a starter, which we both really liked, but would have like some dipping sauce to go with it.   I ordered some of the "ramen" and he had beef yakisoba. We both agreed that both entrees were very mediocre. Nothing special at all. I was pretty disappointed.   Save your money and buy Top Ramen.
UNE75UiIQsLRtxXod8kJLA : You should really only choose El Torito for Taco Tuesday if you're in the area and you feel exceptionally lazy and patient.  You find your own table, which is sometimes impossible, and then wait forever and a day to order. The tacos themselves are alright considering they're only a dollar each, but the margaritas just taste like icy fruit slushies. Maybe this is a bad sign, but I can never taste more than a drop of tequila in there, which means it's pretty much $4 for blended ice and syrup. The other appetizers are nothing to write home about either, though not horrible. The only thing it has going for it is convenience.  If you're willing to drive out of La Jolla, Fred's and World Famous are better bets for Taco Tuesdays/Wednesdays.
yYsiQ7U_RbFY7s1nvtjuaQ : just say yes to the philly cheesesteak.  when you are tired from working in the lab and need to grab a quick lunch, this is the place to go.  they have all kinds of sandwiches and also, a hot dog special.  their salads are made to order (much like all the other salad places at columbia) and also pretty good.
podig6uk9NPJrihgxrz-eA : i was sad when i moved to atlanta to find a slew of starbucks in midtown...thankfully i found octane.  the coffee is great, free wireless, and a chill ambiance.
swB566SdrD9jeiE2XXQklw : I love Kitchenette. There's no getting around that. They have truly excellent breakfast food.  I have been known to get my butt out of bed and get here before 11 am for their $7 or $8 breakfast special which includes bottomless coffee, and a delicious delicious breakfast sandwich. I don't know what you've heard about their biscuits, but if someone placed a whole tray of them in front of me, I would probably eat through them until I couldn't fit anymore in my body. At all. Add a fried egg on top with some cheese and bacon? Heaven. All for under $10? I am crying that I can't do this every day of the week. (Monday through Friday). Of course, there is that wonderful thing called a day job that's keeping me from it. BUT I WANT IT SO BAD.  Other things that are delicious at Kitchenette: the omlette with apples and jack cheese, mac and cheese, french toast.  Truth be told, I'm sure everything is awesome here. Their hot chocolate has a HOMEMADE marshmallow in it. It's almost $5 for the thing, but most of the time I just can't resist it. Also try the pink lemonade.  Writing this review has made me hungry. Kitchenette, I will be seeing you this week. I can't stay away.
hBWEmvktrFvA0PZd9N1HVQ : I was here with my wife recently. The vibrant atmosphere buzzed with good music - both complemented the decor, a good balance of sophistication and rustic, a balance of old-world and current. The food was flavourful, distinct, and well-developed. The spaghetti dish lived up to its yelp reviews. The service was prompt, polite, and quick. The gnocchi was tasteful and rich. Good choice but loud.
hyBY-Rw7uLF_uDXTyPZlWQ : A place to stop for the following reasons :  1. To do some school work. 2. To read a book all by yourself 3.  To get some good biscotti 4. Yes!!! get the good damn coffee   -Smriti
O2BrGkKOmyddL-t4ytqqMw : I was in Boston for a few days and remembered seeing Mr. Bartley's Burger Cottage on that insufferable douchebag Guy Fieri's show Diners, Drive-ins and Dives. So I figured why not, I love meat and all things fried and I have a $35 per diem food expense so I might as well.  I take the train from my hotel to Hah-vid Sqweh, it was a brisk January evening in the 30s so I tried not to waste too much time getting there. I did remark on how the area reminded me a lot of a cross between Chicago's Lincoln Park and Wicker Park neighborhoods, half bohemian, half pretentious riche nouveau. Finally I arrived at the Cottage and the first thing I noticed was a lack of line. I thought this place was -always- crowded, this did not bode well.  I got inside and was attended to immediately, put in my order of an American Idol (burger with bacon, cheese, mushrooms and onions), sweet potato fries and some onion rings. I was taking it back to the hotel so I wanted to make sure I got a little bit of everything. I waited for an awful long time, more than I thought necessary for what I ordered, and had a hard time finding a place to stand as everywhere I stood was seemingly in the way of one waitress or another. I eventually just sat at an empty table and continued my wait.  My food finally ready I left, grabbed a soda from the 7-11 next to the train and went back to the hotel, waiting to devour what I had to assume was a feast for the eyes, tongue and soul. I got upstairs, unpacked my dinner, tossed something random on the tele and dug into the burger.  In a word, underwhelming. In two words, pretty standard. I tried the sweet potato fries, same deal. Not too crisp, not very well seasoned and just meh overall. But the onion rings, o-ho the onion rings were surely a different tale right? Wrong. Practically no seasoning, over-breaded and just greasy without any benefit of salt or sweet to make it all worth it.   I noisily but unenthusiastically finished the burger, fries and onion rings, regretting my decision overall. Both the chinese I had the night prior as well as the mexican the next night fared much better. Maybe it's because I'm from Chicago, a foodie's town, that I was so unimpressed. Who knows. I don't plan on being back in Boston so it doesn't matter if I don't plan on going back but maybe this will prevent someone else from making that mistake.
cdAXQORRxD-jBuf6UCUF0Q : this is it ! it doesn't get any better than a top dog . i been going to top dogs for over 30 years now . i still have not found a better place to get a dog . Sauerkraut and the hot russian muster is off the chain . if you like great sausage you'll love this place
ZJ-cZZIXGPusNO36xYo6Hg : When your only competition is Sbarro's the only thing you have to do is not suck. SliceTruck does not suck.  I usually frequent them whenever they frequent UCLA and I haven't been eating a large pizza at home over 3 days. Their pizza is simple, decently made, and reasonably priced.  The pepperoni is a bit small for my tastes, but in terms of balance with the other ingredients, is fine. Their hot garlic is both hot (as in spicy) and garlicy. Crust has a nice crunch, but can get chewy once cooled. The sauce and cheese are both also pretty good.  I guess it's kind of annoying that there's only a 5 minute window of ultimate deliciousness, but when you eat this pizza in that window, it's pretty good.
su8wUZmx9PCByWuN8fpYog : WTF??  They no longer have Cholula!!  From now on, it's BYOCondiments.
gJA5qx4LXjQs0vX1FFPb8w : When you make the Asian Ghetto look like Chez Panisse by comparison, that's not good. Not good at all.
ni3FCWGTnyf8HOSIAmba_g : Was tasty and all but was surprised at price (it was 'amazing', other reviewer? Meh).   Since I had no idea of the price (is it posted anywhere? I looked for a few minutes to no avail--though since I have no concept of frozen yogurt weight it wouldn't have helped me much anyway), I got a pretty small bowl. It was maybe an equivalent to a scoop and a half of ice cream, and it ended up being more than $4. For $4 at Coldstone (a slightly expensive  ice cream place) I could have gotten four times the amount.  edit: I see another person saying it's cheap and I feel bad for my rating which is mostly based on how very expensive it was. Is a normal frozen yogurt place $10 a person or something?
Nem1UGxUcFUZMYloVS-vJg : This Geoff's used to be cool, used have two locations until it was sold the the guy who owns Cafe Zog.  NO more store baked meats, NO more homemade soups and cheeky service, when they could make ten sandwiches at a time and tell a good joke.  Now there's only, one and I dare not eat at any of them ever again it just doesn't taste like it used to.  BLAH. Superlative CRAP
dLDVc5HjcwkpD97g9M-Czg : Came here with a couple of friends once for lunch. The food and service were both excellent, especially for the price.
cQsHPLYfqvrHsS8n4bplbw : This is a good, cheap restaurant.  They give you a ton of food, and it is surprisingly decent.  I usually get a calzone, but I like their chicken dishes too.
dGbYvgUwbtzDtkA_i4LgbA : Halloween brunch with with my girls.    We had to wait pretty long to get a table since there were 5 of us, but we seated inside and we were all very hungry.  This place is pretty small so if you plan on bringing a big group be prepared to wait a while for them to make room for a table.  I ordered the Chorizo con Huevos.  It comes with homefries and your choice of corn or flour tortillas.  I love corn tortillas and chorizo so this scramble was the best.  The flavor of the chorizo was great and the eggs were scrambled really well.  The homefries had a nice mixture of french fried potatoes and sauteed potatoes.  I really enjoyed it a lot, as well as my friends biscuit which I was able to eat some of.  I like the homey feel of this place and the food is without a doubt very good.
DKDcqPCEZCQ99zQf2CKEcA : I used to line up at this store every year for Black Friday.  I mean, there's a Ralphs next door open 24/7 for food / bathroom runs, and most college kids go home, so the line is 10x shorter than any other Best Buy!!    So why the 1-star?  Well, last couple years I stopped going cuz in 2007 I was number 9 in line and got a Black-Friday ticket for all the doorbusters including the best laptop deal.    The tickets mean they will hold your item, and are good until 12 noon, at which time they give up your item to the next person.    I got a ticket for a $249 laptop (minimum 15 per store), and everyone else gets a $300 laptop, which is the same thing bundled with a mouse and a bunch of optimization crap.    Well, I presented my ticket during checkout at 10 am, but they grabbed the wrong one, and gave me a bundled laptop and charged me $300 for it.  I didn't notice until I loaded everything onto my car and realized I was charged an extra $50.    I went back and talked to the cashier, store manager, and then got on the phone with corporate, and they said there's nothing they could do b/c all the doorbuster laptops were already gone.  My reply--"Hello!  I have the ticket and it's supposed to be held for me until 12 noon, so even if someone grabbed the wrong one, how could it be gone?" Manager Dick "The Prick" Stonewall just uttered the same phrase "cant' do anything."    Called my CC company to chargeback to them, but they kept saying I got the "optimized" package, so I should have paid $300.  I argued that I didn't want an optimized package, and it was given to me without my knowledge.    To make a long story short, the tools that work here care nothing for the customer.  The manager himself, or some smooth-skin college freshman boy he was boning was probably the one who switched my laptop so he could keep it.    Not to mention, these days, Amazon will price match Best Buy's Black Friday prices, with free shipping and no tax.  Unless you like spending the night in line for higher prices, avoid this store and all Best Buys if you can.  5 years later, I get to give you guys the finger.  Revenge is sweet.  As for my chargeback, PM me if you want to know the end of the story.  I can't post it here b/c the lawsuit is still ongoing.
PZYc-NfUdE4WCJTis9RbNA : I refuse to go anywhere else!  I get  the best haircut and color with my favorite hairdresser on the planet, Mr. William Santana.  He will hook you up.  You don't have to have a clue as to what you want because he will provide suggestions and will always be spot on.  He will even sing you a classic 70's or 80's tune if you so request.
gBKMbiz2Giy_B4c16e0SKQ : I have been to this Jersey Mike's location about a dozen times now. I am sorta obsessed with their sandwiches and it's the closest JM's to my house. If this review was just for the food it would be 4 stars. The service/cleanliness of this location leaves a lot to be desired. Almost every time I come here the garbage is full or overflowing. I've been here in the morning and right before closing so it doesn't matter what time of day it is. The tables are usually filthy and I end up having to wipe them off with napkins. All of the other JM locations I've been to have the friendliest employees. The Westwood crew are the most disgruntled bunch of workers anywhere. One time I walked in and had to wait till they guy taking orders was done with his cell phone conversation. Another time there was nobody in the store but 2 employees outside sitting on a bench. The food is real inconsistent at this location as well. I usually order the same thing - #13. Every time I get it, either one of the meats is missing or it has too much/too little lettuce, vinegar, pickles, etc... Last weekend I ended up with the top of a wheat bun and the bottom of a white bun. The time before I ordered a hot sub and the guy taking orders totally forgot to make it. After 5 minutes I asked if he got my cheese take order and he annoyingly replied yea, and then proceeded to take his time and make it. It's too bad because I love their food but man this location needs some management.
v52m_nP0nWYKynpac6ImDA : If it weren't for the prices, this place would probably get 5 stars. While CC did introduce me to an out-of-this-world sandwich combination (Rosemary-Goat cheese with honey oh my my) that wasn't that expensive, I don't think $7-8 for the rest of the sandwiches is reasonable at all.   But for that Rosemary, goat cheese, honey combination alone, this place gets my vote to return to time and time again.
oFauKtut7bYqnZhsAvnqqw : I'm not sure what's unique about this place. It certainly doesn't live up to any standard of local or innovative food, but it has some pretty tasty stuff.  I had a Cobb Salad and a pumpkin bar/muffin thing. The pumpkin sweet? Awesome. I want to know how to make it myself.  The Cobb salad was ok--lots of cheddar cheese, tasty shredded chicken, nice well-done bacon, and a hardboiled egg. All that was good. The guacamole was not fresh (tasted like the premade grocery store crap), which is a disappointment considering that guacamole is probably the easiest dish on the planet to make (avocado, salt, and a fork...where can it go wrong). I was left wanting a piece of bread with my salad.  I also didn't like the plastic container it was served in. Those things activate my feelings of enviro-guilt. I would have preferred a ceramic or even paper plate and some metal utensils. However, the air conditioning was very welcome on a hot day so I'll forgive them for plastic.  I will probably return for more pumpkin goodies, but I doubt the sandwiches and salads will bring me back.
wwsIz_b4TkPmJtt5ng9Izg : This is just to update and reiterate that this is my favorite Starbucks (of  course, if I had to pick a Starbucks to begin with).  The atmosphere here is extremely conducive to working or studying.  There is not a lot of chit chat as in other Starbucks locations in Pasadena (mainly the one in Old Town Pasadena).  Staff is very friendly and really get to know the regulars.    A lot of comfortable tables and chairs for your laptop and other work.  There is also a very large table in the middle that seats about 6-8 people - perfect for any large study groups.    If I'm looking for places to get work done outside of my home office in my apartment, I can always get work done here (as well as at the Pasadena Public Library - see separate review).
Zp6OMBykOqxZfKg1Bzuqcw : i've always wanted to see what zigo was about, with the yellow storefront. so, i went in today!  it feels very european - perhaps because they sell lots of cadburys and other british foods. kind of reminded me of tesco, but without the supermarket feel.  anyway, coffee is pretty good! good selection of snackies and sandwiches. it's pretty chill, and being a designer,  i like their branding.  also, the berry scones are not to be missed.
pthDVep-9hXt2V_jvm8naw : I went to the Wax loft for the first time today. I selected it based off of its rave reviews on Yelp and proximity to my apartment. However I will never go back there again.   I have been getting brazilian bikini waxes for about two years now. I am used to the pain and it usually does not bother me and I generally experience no adverse effects or skin sensitivity following. Today this was NOT the case!   From the moment I stepped in till I paid, I was there for 19 minutes. Fast yes, thorough, NO. You don't want to necessarily skimp on time when getting a bikini wax... seriously... I didn't exactly want or expect drive-through speed! My aesthetician never even took her sunglasses off of her head!  Stacy, my waxer, seemed to know exactly what she was doing, and I might have just caught her on an off-day, but I tried several attempts at conversation and she did not respond. The wax was very painful and she said nothing and did nothing to abate the pain! I realize that paper strips are more painful -- I'm used to cloth at my old salon -- but this was really ridiculous! Another odd note on cleanliness... she wore one glove... but used both hands while waxing. So confusing.  At the end of the abrupt wax she handed me a stick with some cream on it and told me to rub it on and let her know if she missed anything -- as she left the room! I still had some very sticky spots (one of which still had paper towel stuck to it). I pointed it out to her and she said the cream will help remove the wax.... um... but it didn't!  I assumed that the cream was just a post-epilatory wax remover/skin soother... When I got to the counter to pay... IT STARTED TINGLING like I had been covered in Icy/Hot! I mentioned it to the lady ringing me up and she said, "yeah, it should go away in about twenty minutes. The cooling sensation is weird, huh?" AND THAT WAS IT!   Seriously. It was awkward and NOT soothing in any way, shape, or form! It did nothing to remove the copious amount of remaining wax and now 8 hours later -- I'm still red, sticky, and sensitive! This has never happened before!   If Stacy had maybe just been a little bit more friendly or taken just a couple of extra minutes of attention to professionally explain her products/process... I would have still had the adverse reaction, but I never would have written a review.
ue4hGWszfBF0HCOgR2MBjg : So I just finished running the Pittsburgh Marathon and I decided I needed some Mexican Food. Where to go. Found Mad Mex. Thought we were ordering the happy hour drinks but we weren't. Bummer - Big Bill. The waiter asked questions about additions to our meal and every addition increased the price. The food was OK but the bill was way to large. Wouldn't go back.
15W3QLO46uFhlFoQGDxVCw : Cheap Pita wraps (schwarma esque at best). This place is basically the default for lunch if you're on the budget and want a decent amount of food. $6 buys you two gyros and $8 buys you two schwarmas. You get four toppings and two sauces on each sandwich. The meat tends to be dry and salty but mixed in with the vegetables you get decent food for your money.   Its halal which is a big factor for all the muslim students.
uiAy3m0nyVW-2VHjR_u3HQ : I was really disappointed with the service. I go to the middle east often to check out bands, but last night we went for dinner, drinks and open mic. The bartender/waiter was careless. The following things happened: 1) Our pitcher was waay too foamy. We were 4 people, and the pitcher only filled 3 beers. What a disappointment.  2) We ordered another pitcher of something else, maybe it was just a new keg or something.. unfortunately something had happened to the draft and they can only serve bottles. I work in the service industry.. I know stuff like this happens- no biggie. We'll take sam in bottles.. 3) 15 minutes later: no sam in bottles? Hmmm.. okay PBR- lets be cheapskates.   4) Another 15 minutes later: Bartender/waiter informs us that they don't have PBR either.  5) We eventually found a beer they DID have however replacements took way too long to enjoy the buzz.   The food was awesome. Rice and Kibbeh was great, the burger was delicious. The open mic was a little disappointing, although the MC did perform at the end and he sang some great tunes. I want to come back again- hopefully the bad service was just a one time thing.
4mX6CwWBFWJTD8C_n5fFHg : Great little place, SO excited to have this here in Cambridgeport.  After walking by and then in a few times to taste the yummy samples they had set out, I finally went in with intent to buy and had a fantastic cheese shopping experience.  The staff were really friendly and helpful, and when I couldn't accurately describe the kind of cheese I wanted, he had me taste samples until I found what I was looking for.  I haven't bought wine or beer here yet, but for delicious cheeses this is a great selection (lots of local options and imported cheeses), knowledgeable and accessible staff, and surprisingly better prices than the Whole Foods cheese counter down at the bottom of Cambridgeport.  I
S-IlJeCWSwE3EYaeDfmdLQ : Good sandwiches, but I think Potbelly's is better. They have an amazing avocado spread, but there's never enough of it. Paying for extra avocado spread doesn't get you much more, unfortunately, so don't waste money on extra spread.
OcQnNi1DyrQ1fNeCOgpsOw : Their sangrias are wonderful, but that's about all I can say. The wait is just too long to justify ever going here again. My last time, I came here for my 5 year reunion. The event person overbooked the restaurant and there were 2 reunions going on at once. My group, unfortunately was relegated to the outside alleyway. We ordered tapas, but it took at least an hour an a half before we ever saw our food. Our waitress was great, but the place was so poorly understaffed. I felt so absolutely bad for her. It's just not OK to be so highly understaffed, knowing fully well that there are huge parties coming in like that. Wretched wretched. We all ended up meeting up later at our hotels and eating a late dinner.  Wretched.
JtY-cbMJx-vh6qE_qmlxqg : Beautiful, cool venue, saw some wonderful operas there.
gXWbHFYZADMBXQw5MngQ6w : I wanted to go to school in a city. I wanted to go far away from home. I wanted to attend a small liberal arts college.  But then I got that acceptance letter from Stanford and I just didn't know how to say no. (Plus, Macalester's head of music....CREEPY!)  I love Stanford. Don't get me wrong by my 3 star rating, but my Stanford experience is atypical. I am not an engineer. I'm not even premed. I'm a music major. This means that I am a member of a small, almost hidden department. We're more like a co-op than an academic department, more a family than a system of professors, grad students, and undergrads. I love my department, and I shudder to think what my life would be like if it weren't for the people there who I have met.  And the weather! Who can beat the weather? Certainly not the Ivys, and definitely not backwoods Ohio where I almost ended up for four years. I don't mind the architecture, and the sculpture garden is magnificent.   So why only three stars? You ask. Well, here's the deal. We are a research school which means about 50% of the faculty should never be put in front of a room a students. Some of these people simply can't teach. Furthermore, there is a whole line of red tape that has to be followed before anyone can do anything. For instance, my friend and I put on an opera this year, but to get funding we couldn't just say "We're music students. Stanford is lacking in an opera program. We're going to create one." Rather, we had to come up with some "real academic" (actual words of the undergraduate research adviser assigned us) reason for this particular opera (Hansel and Gretel) to be at Stanford. We did it, and it was fine..but it was also unnecessary.   Oh yeah, and I'm tired of the condescending attitude toward the humanities majors. Sure, we probably won't have jobs straight out of school...but we also know how to think abstractly...so there!
-RFRJX5BtEjjx4nI4wSWJw : Ok, maybe 5 stars it's too much, but it's been almost a month since graduation and I am feeling nostalgic. Traddies is awesome, though. How many people can say they have a cool bar smack in the middle of campus? Each day has a different happy hour theme. The regular prices though not as cheap as the nine oh, are still decent. As far as food, gotta love the chicken fingers....
NxY8ug5kZu3fiE9-2qFr1A : headed over to medici to do some studying. it smelled like trash, all through the lower level. the downstairs was really hot, but upstairs was a little cooler. the price for a small iced coffee seemed a little steep, but it was good. the chairs are comfortable even though they don't look like they will be. there is not a lot of table space, in my opinion, and the outlets are sparse. also, you have to use a code to use the internet, which kinda sucks if you're all set up upstairs and then have to go back downstairs to see what the code is.
P5bfkT7qWprbFDtSFoAoAg : The menu is so overwhelming with so many decious that sound delicious and look even better in the photos.   I love the ambiance here, always have, its a fun resturant to enjoy some tastey Italian food while enjoying the italian music and hundreds of photographs covering the walls.   The portions are rediculously large so its perfect for large groups and sharing while sampling more of the dishes,   i love the calamari, and most of the items on the menu. Honestly you cant really go wrong here, traditional italian, so many options and huge portions. =) you'll feel like a fatty when you leave for sure though. =)
Lje5IhxftrSxS3J6LfFXOA : When they were repairing this, it was moved to a little black-painted store across the street.  Even today, it's packed with kids and sometimes the homeless...  This is a beautiful building that has wonderful stone work and is a boon to the local non-university people who want a free library just to check out and read from. We should really expand this for the sake of the community!
Qb8hG6KaLSTTT96kw2J7Xg : Build your own burrito and free WiFi, all in the same glorious place. Forget the coffee shop (ok, maybe not forget), but consider Boloco as your new spot take your laptop and get a little work done, all while being able to get a delicious, well-priced meal.
aovcDbqelzGsC71mVLyelQ : I like their grilled chicken or beef sandwiches. Different then your average sandwich but it tastes good, cheap price and open fairly late.
wuOzLFbf7MrVV_G3LK_DiQ : Having never been for Portuguese food, the wife and I had to give this place a try.  Hearing a lot of people speaking Portuguese when we walked in was the first good sign of the evening so we ordered a couple appetizers for research purposes.  We had the white cheese with pate and the cured ham with white cheese and tomatoes (we like cheese).  Both were great.  For the meal we had the Cataplana (seafood steamed with delicious things) and the salt cod with fried potatoes.  Again, both were delicious.  This place is great and we would love to go back for more.  The staff was nice and the service was quick.  It is not a cheap meal but you pay for what you get.  Loved it.
99vHziNHRhItLC20zbzryQ : I rarely dole out five stars for any establishment, so you know this place is special when it earns five stars.  I've been frequenting Yogurt Park since I moved to the Bay Area in 1993.  Back in the "olden days", a mini cost $1.10!  Now the price has increased over the years but it is still a very inexpensive treat especially since the portions are so large.    The yogurt is served in cups and stuffed to the brim with toppings.  I don't know of any other frozen yogurt place that is so generous with toppings.  At other places, you can typically expect to only receive three spoonfuls of toppings.  Not at Yogurt Park where the employees shove in multiple scoops of toppings in addition to a serving at the top.  My favorite topping is the fresh cookie dough but there are many other delicious choices such as brownies, M&M's, hot fudge, etc.  My favorite flavor is creamy peanut butter despite the fact that it is low fat.  Nonetheless, it remains less fattening than ice cream and tastes better too!  A large portion with topping costs $2.85, which is a bargain.  I always take friends from out-of-town and they all report favorable reviews.    The only drawbacks include long lines during evening hours, obnoxious employees, and limited parking.  However, it's worth all those obstacles for the yummy yogurt.  Moreover, you can buy a prepaid bonus card, which offers a free yogurt upon completion of the certificate.
6i0bqioTEAGneHNdKgpuiQ : I like this place, eventhough I dont go there offen but its really go.
ohpRmt-86ieyTDxxLkhjZA : Close your browser RIGHT NOW and Go There; I hope BTB never loses it's casual perfection; the atmosphere is friendly (fratboys on tequila - yeah but, what of it?  We all gotta hang somewhere.)  The food is making my mouth water just thinking about how unsurpassedly awesome-o it is.  The diablo (habanero rojo) sauce is hot and not particularly flavorful but, sometimes I want ridiculous HOT & it's just like that.  The green is wonderful and the mild (lots of pico) is an eloquent and floral expression of what salsa should be - see?  it's makin' me all poetic :)  like I said - just go - you'll be yelping like this, too!
TF4j7LZ5UrQMygcm3hZubg : This place is amazing! My friend and I went about a few days after they opened and we were seated instantly. The waiters and waitresses were extremely nice and very helpful and the food was to die for. I had a vegan reuben, brown cow (like a root beer float) and split a plate of fries with my friend while she ordered the stuffed french toast. Both of us couldn't get over how amazing the food was but I'm a sucker for diner food. We also thought the decor was spot on and very tasteful.   We also stopped by the bakery before we left and picked up a double chocolate cupcake and a slice of Boston cream cake. Again, the staff was amazing and the baked goods were some of the best vegan baked goods that I've ever had. I will be getting more Boston cream cake!
Hw1Ip0q624HDD0n98aNwdA : Grabbed a beer with a good friend here today.  It was a Saturday at around 5pm.  Service and atmosphere were great.  Seating was outdoors which was nice on a Sat summer afternoon.   I wasn't in the mood for a beer for some reason so I went with an Arnold Palmer to start.  That was great.  I ordered a small pomme frites and the abbey burger.  The pomme frites were eh...ok.  I guess my expectations were too high, I just had some pomme frites from a place names Duckfat in Portland, ME two weeks ago and those were the best ever.  These didn't really come close.  I mean they were good, just not as good as what I have had recently.  The burger was good too, but I'm not sure what people are saying on here that it is better than Father's Office.  I honestly, don't think so.  My girlfriend just brought me home a half of a fathers office burger, and I warmed it up and ate it the next morning and it was better than the Abbey Burger.    With all of that said, I did enjoy the place and the rest of the menu looked promising.  The service was really friendly and welcoming and it does seem like a cool place to hang out.  I would go back, but not for the frites or the abbey burger.
Iw19edd9Ed8e28qYIDNC8g : If it wasn't for Yoshiko, the hygienist, I would have left years ago. I have been coming here for about 11+ years and ever since the ownership changed hands to Dr. Hakim, the service has been deteriorating rapidly.  One year I was told that I needed a filling due to a cavity. I have never had cavities before and wanted to do a little research at home before having any work done. The Dr. urged me to have the cavity filled immediately and told me it should be done as soon as possible, otherwise it would lead to further, more serious problems. A half year passed and I was due for my next appointment. I went in praying that the cavity did not grow. However, when I came in a half year later, they never even mentioned my cavity and my teeth/gums actually improved. I became extremely skeptical that I actually had a cavity in the first place because I was told initially that if I didn't get a filling, the cavity could only get worse. In addition to this episode, I have also been pushed to purchase antibiotics, teeth whitening services, and invisiline. One member of my family has already found a new dentist and the other parties of my family are thinking of doing the same. I will follow suit soon. It is sad because I once enjoyed going for a cleaning, but now with each visit, it just seems that they are trying to squeeze every penny out of me. :(
yVu_yPfHMm9jf5f-lVDqmA : Whether you love art or not, this is definitely a cool summer-time activity to engage in on a warm and sunny day. My step-mother is an artist, so many summers I would come with her as she perused the crafts. When I came to the University of Michigan for school, I had to appreciate the art fair on a completely different level. Many streets are blocked off, so it was extremely difficult to find parking while taking summer classes. In fact, it was downright annoying! If you are going to come out here, I suggest parking at the Commuter Lot on State Street and taking the bus into the fair. That's better than the hassle of finding parking!
9k7iV51jlHy4T-orejd1wg : I'm not really a burger person. But when I moved to Cambridge, I got burgers at Bartley's. I brought all my friends there. Then I went vegetarian. And I didn't go anymore, and I told my friends about it, but that I couldn't go there with them, because what's the point of going to Bartley's and not getting a burger? Then I discovered that they have veggie burgers. And it turns out that their veggie burgers are my favorite veggie burgers ever.  I don't care too much for their fries. My boyfriend likes the sweet potato fries, but they don't do much for me either. When I first got the onion rings, I wasn't too impressed, but I have come to appreciate them for what they are, which is floppy, large, thin, sweet, and lightly crispy on the outside. They're a different style from what I was used to, which is more crunch, and thicker, but less onion.  I prefer sitting outside, which is still tight but not impossible. I find that inside I barely have space for my backpack. Also, there's a table in the very back that gets a wicked draft and makes for an unpleasant dining experience. But you go often enough, you learn what to avoid if you can.  Despite the fact that it's a madhouse when it's busy, I think the food's actually better than at 3pm when you're the only customer. Maybe the chefs get in the zone or something. Usually the range of food quality is "very good" to "omg amazing", but that one 3pm jaunt was "hmm. really?" Also, even though the line that extends outside the door can look intimidating, it moves pretty fast.  And they just updated their menu, so if you haven't been lately, that's as good an excuse as any.
gYHEHsRwWNZGVDxn8uoTRg : Wow. I've never met a better specialist in my life. My appointment was at 2, I was in his office at 2. I didn't wait for ONE minute.That NEVER happens.  I box - my hands are a mess. I was X-rayed and Dr. Brown saw me right away. Injected with cortizone and got an rX. I don't have to follow up with him.   Magnificent - I wouldn't see anyone else.
jFW2w0BY7Y43Iz7cURMQOg : I admit it: I love hotel restaurants. They're often artfully decorated, the service is almost always phenomenal, they're open all day long, and they usually don't mind if you linger longer than the average diner. And yeah, these are some of the reasons I love Pacci.  I've stopped in for a variety of reasons: quickie drinks at the bar, a full dinner, a bite of breakfast, and they've never failed to deliver. The menu and concept is innovative without being overly trendy, with various kinds of carpaccio (even a fruit carpaccio in the AM hours), Justin Timberlake look-a-like waiters (when he was in his vest and tie phase), and a soaring space that doesn't feel at all corporate or cookie-cutter. It's the perfect spot for an intimate date, a power lunch, or some gourmet granola as you scour the morning's headlines. A great addition to Midtown for locals and tourists alike.   #yelp365 15/365
HQkyEzqG45pM_z1WN9xxOA : Looked around for a local rush-order for several thousand flyers. Arthur at Minuteman was very cordial and helpful over the phone, and we will be sending him some digital proofs to get a quote. I'll update this review once we get final product, but compared to a few other places I'd already called, Minuteman seems to have their act together, Arthur was very knowledgeable and willing to accomodate, and I think that alone merits a first-time mention on Yelp.
xkXbc2Uni7U4I7_Un_JJQQ : The service was fast and friendly.  A+ in that category.  However the food was overpriced and mehck.  For the same price I could get yummier food at Mi Piace.  The complimentary pesto and bread was tasty.  We got the focaccia completa to start "thin focaccia bread with arugala and prosciutto".  It was sauceless pizza.  It was hard to eat...arugula and prosciutto was falling all over the place.  Good idea, poorly executed.  Then we got the gnocchi with the peas.  I love gnocchi, but not here.  The sauce starts off bland, then turns bitter.  At one point I thought they might have been trying to pass off glue as sauce.  The chocolate sponge cake was good.  Made with dark chocolate.  Dark chocolate gooood....  Sooo, perhaps we will return one day and make better menu choices?  For lunch, though, because dinner was too expensive for what we got.
HhBrBgq99I6KYXl_r-pfFg : The only reason I shop here is because they have Kid Robot toys. Stopped by yesterday for a Family Guy Kid Robot toy and left.
Wx2veM46wc8pdePNMX-Zrg : This is not a full-on Apple Store, so don't expect the world of them. Their in-store stock is somewhat limited and they really dont have much in the way of software. One cool thing is that the educational discount is already applied to all items, and you just have to affirm that you are entitled to receive it.  They have nice people working here who definitely want to help you, but they may or may not possess all the Mac smarts that they profess to you. Case in point: I went in for a Mac Mini and it was determined that the best course of action would be to order it online and have it shipped (went off w/o a hitch, 6 days later). The guy at the IL Apple Center said I would need a certain adapter for the Mac Mini to attach to my monitor (which had a DVI input). Fact of the matter is the Mac Mini comes with just such a cable in the box. I spent $18 when I did not need to (and unfortunately I opened the package and lost the receipt).
lBUHIJWvcA4Ilm8TLrWd2w : after an afternon of ATVing at Pismo, we decide to head out to SLO and get our grub on at this famous local spot in san luis obispo.  finding a place to park wasn't bad, they don't have a private lot but plenty of street parking space.  first things first, had to take a piss.... after i used the restroom(which is separated from the actual restaurant but just a few step from the counter) i got in line...in the back cause ther were hellllla mofos there.  this place was packed! people walking all over the place...outside, they got a larget patio so the scene looked really live and casual...inside, there's order numbers being yelled out, multiple convos, the smell o bar b que....THEY GOT A BAR with tap(daz what im talkin bout) and there were pretty ladies everywhere(that;s what im REALLY talkin bout).  for reals, though...the atmosphere was awesome!  anyways at my turn to order, I decided on buffalo wangs and a salmon sammich....yeah, i had to try thie wings and yeah, a salmon sandwich. as i waited for my order, i sat at the bar area wid som of mah folks. and yeah....had to get me a beer for the waiting period....shiet! when there's a bar and you're waiting for your order, what the F else u suppose to do? plus, they have multiple TV's and football was on ALL of them....NEED I SAY what i say??? THAZ WHA IM TALKIN BOU", nugga!! Oh Boi!  when my number was called, i swaggerly walked to the pick up counter(yeah, im a G like dat), hollered out my number back and the fellas hooked up my order.  i walked it all back to my table where my folks/famz were all chillin and i proceeded to get my smash on(after offering my loved ones if they wanted some of my order cause you should always offer since sharing is caring!)  The wings, i felt were smaller than what I am accustomed to but they were tasty, nonetheless(is that one word?) but don't get me wrong...NO body eat a hot wing like ur boy eat a hot wing so i splashed extra hot sauce on this batch RIGHT HUURRRRR. i used the 2 chicken wing devour then few bites of sammich followed by wash wid beer combo....YUMMMMMMM!   the sandwhich was good...not HOLY SHIET good but MMMM DAYAUM good.  the wings, like i said, tasty but i have had better but its all good.  my famz had the tri tip sandwhich(which is the top order there) and they seemed joyful...there were like ( of us and all 9 were happy like a clam.  what's also nice is that while u eat, the waitresses and their cute booties be walkin all over the place so that's ALL GOOD!  if you in SLO...stop by firestone grill.  it's worth the wait and the price and the experience and the drive(maybe)  butr don't take my word for it....actually, go ahead and do that cause 'word is born' and i'm daddy and 'daddy knows', child...... lol    really, check it out, tell yelp wutcha think without expecting anyone to give a shit what you wrote......(WINK)....DEUCES!!!!!!
ebYc8QPdUGDmEJkNFIM6kg : I loved The Counter up in Palo Alto when I lived there, but both times I've been to the Pasadena one, the service has been painfully slow.   My second trip last week was bad enough that I won't return to this location. We were there around 1:30 on a Monday. It took about 40 minutes for our food to be served. Apparently, there was a large take-out order slowing down the kitchen, but our waiter didn't tell us this until after he was bringing our plates to the table after we'd been staring him down for the previous 30 minutes wondering what was going on. No warning when we were seated or when we placed our order, or at any point in the ensuing wait.  Our waiter then managed to disappear again, causing us to wait 10 minutes after we were done eating to get our check. It's a small place, so no idea what he was doing.  First visit here was also slow.  Food was good as always, but this place needs to get its act together - no burger is that good.
K-Kfs0POtWwn85aO_AIicg : born from the ashes of rachel's kitchen in the south end and boasting of L'Espalier/Sel De La Terre bloodlines....comes this supremely tasty southern inspired gem near Kendall.    The menu is deceptively simple but the food is done really well...the pork, catfish, roasted chicken is prepared just right.   Appetizers - boiled peanuts probably not boiled in briny enough water but that's probably OK.    The kicker is the fried oysters....oh...so tasty.  The only criticism I have is that....need more oysters!   and maybe have them come in a po'boy...  but that's about it.      hmm...Hungry Mother? Helmand?  maybe Kendall isn't as scary as i thought?
WiU6E0ZDGk5fpruzHVHb5A : First you see about ten types of cookies.  They are all amazing, so take your pic, and you get to pick two.  Then you get to pick out of a dozen (or so) types of of ice-cream flavors.  Put it all together and you get a very delicious ice-cream sandwich.    So far we've got enough for 4 stars.  Make the whole sandwich $1.50 and 5 stars are born.  Enjoy!  Update 3.13.08: I tried their shaved ice and ice-cream combo, and it was delicious as well.  now I just want to see someone buy one of their hot dogs.
-Fwf9pknh9N8u08kPBGTRQ : A true culinary adventure.  Food was perfectly prepared and presented.  Flavors were unlike typical French fare available in the area.  A real treat for the distinguishing diner.  Loved the wine pairings and would recommend to others.  We never even looked at a wine list, simply deferred to their knowledge.  Especially enjoyed the chicken prepared two ways.
zFVOGiAexqClaipgo_HvBQ : I think the best thing about my living at Unit 1 my freshman year at cal would have to be its proximity to Top Dog.  Outsiders won't know why hot dogs have all us locals and Cal grads all giddy but that's only because they havent tried the perfection that is Lemon Chicken.  Everyone has their own fav top dog.  Mine just happens to give you the nastiest, stinkiest burps known to mankind afterwards. Seriously. I unleashed one in my friends car one night after grabbing Top Dog and he almost passed out.  Best when piled high with onions and ketchup/mustard.
UnVSphyQ5K2TBOeyQPN_Zg : I was excited to come here when it first opened. I love outdoor seating! The space is wonderful, the service ok and the food could be better.  I have come here a couple of times and hoped each time that I would love it. But that is not to be. It still one of the places I prefer to go to in the neighborhood due to their lovely space but I dont go here for the food or drinks.   The first time I came for cocktails. I ordered the frozen margarita $8 since it was the more affordable drink on the menu. It tasted like a slushee and NOT like a margarita as it should. Sad when even Dallas BBQ or D&B has a better frozen margarita than HT. Cocktails ran about $14. Beer was about $6-$9 per pint.   Food menu is very limited, I think this might be because their kitchen is not adequate enough for a more extensive menu compared to the amount of tables they have. If you order something on the menu, I would stick to the sandwiches and burgers. These seem to be decent.   The second time, I ordered the pulled BBQ pork sandwich and it was tasty. The sweet potato fries are great and recommend them highly! My friend had the salmon on a cedar plank and it looked ok, but pricey for $22 at lunch time.  The third time I came for brunch, but really wanted breakfast. The brunch menu consists of about 5 lunch items and about 5 breakfast items so it is LIMITED and comes with one drink for $15. I ordered the eggs benedict and a mimosa. I am not really an eggs benedict kind of person, but it was the only thing that appealed to me on the brunch menu for breakfast. Eh! I am not a fan. First it came without the chorizo on top. Then it just tasted sour. I ate it, but I would never order it again. My bf ordered the steak sandwich off the regular menu and it was very tasty indeed and cooked well.  Then we found a hair...yuck! Half way through our meal. I was hoping it was ours and not the kitchen staffs. We reported it to the waitress, and she was very apologetic and even offered us a dessert. I ordered the chocolate and nutella cake and it was delicious! I only hope the staff are more careful and wear hair nets!  During brunch on the weekends, they have a jazz bands that starts playing around noon which is really nice. This place has a lot of potential but so far does not live up to it. I hope they offer a more extensive and affordable menu soon. I know they are suppose to be a beer garden or something, but I would not come for the beer as I am not a beer-drinker, I would come for the food and/or cocktails.
iTzvMHBEfoMZlkAfYQzbXg : finding this place was a DISASTER. it's kind of tucked away in a hidden street and my friend had given me wrong directions. ):    after we got here, we were seated right away. i got what i wanted, getting seated right away but i had a problem with the group of hostesses (i did not understand this. why did they hire so many people so they can stand around jeering at costumers and acting rude? please fire all the rest but one. you really don't need more than one host during lunch hours when it is not busy at all)   after we got seated, the experience turned pleasant. our server was soooo nice and patient. i ordered basil tomato quesadillas and they were absolutely delicious. i highly recommend this! the server even pointed out that it was his favorite on the menu.   ambiance is alright. it reminded me of panera or corner bakery.  parking...well, there is no parking lot. i had to park at a structure and paid ~$5? ugh i like free parking.   quite pricey for a restaurant that looks like panera or corner bakery. (around $15 a person) i guess the food makes up for it :/  so overall, the quesadilla itself would've been five stars but minus 0.5 star for the dumb hostesses, 0.5 for bland ambiance, 0.5 for pricing and another 0.5 for parking. 3 stars.
QIZFEx55ukcTyRrlXCH8RA : I was here for a late dinner with some friends, and while the experience was generally good, the food left something to be desired at times.  The decor was rustic and comfortable and the service was great - bussers filled water glasses flawlessly, everyone got their food at the same time and within a reasonable time frame, and the waitress seemed knowledgable about the beer selection.  We ordered the spinach dip, which was tasty, but the menu says that it's served with pita chips, while ours was served with tri-colored tortilla chips, and the truffle tater tots, which didn't taste particularly truffle-y, and didn't seem to have any Parmesan cheese or pepper on it, as the menu states, but tasted more like cafeteria food circa fourth grade.  They were still good, don't get me wrong - just not "restaurant good".  Not exactly what I would expect from a nicer restaurant...  I got the Steak Wedge Salad, and while it tasted fine, there were three tiny steak tips on it, and though the paper menu said that the dressing was served on the side, it was POURED onto my iceberg wedge, drowning most of the other flavors.  Remind me why this cost $13?  On the other hand, the people I was with enjoyed their meals which were the Fish Tacos and the Paddy Melt.  In conclusion, the food is hit or miss.  And inconsistent with what the menu says.  And not worth the money it costs to consume it.
vPRlkXV2S3i10KW9yOnMBg : I ate here almost once a week when I was in college.  The food's good and the service is great.  Plus, the free tea is a total perk.
upAarU4Bobe_rHMhkNmeGA : First of all, it's pretty rad to have this kind of a bar right on Berkeley's campus. We ventured here right after the CU/Cal game on Saturday (in which CU got STOMPED) so we were all in our Colorado gear. My first instinct was to run.... why did we want to go to a Bear's bar in CU gear after getting stomped?? Surprisingly enough, no one said a word. In fact, everyone was super nice!  The patio is definitely the best part of this bar -- the inside is a bit awkward as the bar is in the middle. Then again, it could have just been awkward because it was totally packed with college kids.   The patio serves beer and some food as well which is very convenient. The best part? There's an entrance and exit in the front and the back so you don't have to walk all the way through the crowded bar to get in/out.  Fun times!
lHPdDwsfH_FmKvt4ffP91A : heh, not really a fan, but hopefully thatll change.  went there for dinner last week with co-workers  +1--1/2 wine on mondays! excellllllentttttt  -1--not REALLY the best porkchop in the world  +1--decent crab cake app (the crab cake was DELISH, but the sauces were....ok at best), good 'adult mac & cheese', everything was high quality and fresh  will def go back......since its 2 seconds from my hotel
7gZHiYGfRB6mChsqfeeO7Q : I was visiting UC for a couple of days and stopped here one cold afternoon for some coffee. This place is huge was wasn't crowded. The coffee and service were good and fast. I came in to check my email so I was disappointed by the poor quality wifi. The mismatched decor was interesting but I had to find a table that my laptop would be level on!
UjYqlvG3RbqUoXWUt0GC_w : I love Cuchi Cuchi.  I always come here on my birthday.  The food, decor, and atmosphere are fabulous and unique.  The scallops Provencale, bracioletta, and St. Jacob's zucchini are my absolute favorites.  I always taste beautiful flavors here that I never taste anywhere else.  The clerico (white sangria) is a must-try.  The place is dimly/romantically lit, the service is good, and the overall atmosphere is festive and fun.
eSldJ7n8nIVZxtUZDrgLfA : Stopped here on the way to Chicago as a result of the reviews. We had a gyro and the Athenian salad with a side of gyro meat.   I liked the coziness an atmosphere of the joint, and the folks behind the counter were very friendly. When it comes down to the food however, I just wasn't impressed. The gyro meat was good, but the pita bread tasted like store bought bread, and the tzaky sauce wa a little weak, my mouth was calling for something more creamy and garlicky. As for the salad, it was good but I was disappointed here as well. For $8 it was a little on the small side and lacked flavor. As for the additional side of gyro meat, for $3.50 we barely got any.  I think we may have ordered the wrong things, or we've developed a taste for the finer things in life. Whatever the reason, I probably won't be stopping back by here...
NIIA3nttWOh-OXGV0KPz2g : First, the receptionist didn't tell me about the parking situation when I made my appt., which is that they have none and you have to park in a lot next door and get validated. When I called I specifically asked for someone who specializes in curly hair, and they gave me their least experienced stylist. I later looked at their website and found out they have 2 other stylists who specifiically concentrate on curly hair.  Then, my stylist was really young and inexperienced and did an ok job on my color but then texturized my curly hair, so now I have had to live with little tiny hairs that stick up all over my head and make it look really frizzy for months afterward. Also, she burned the hell out of my scalp with the color. Plus she was nice enough but she was really talkative about her personal life (I'm mean way TOO personal) which was annoying and pretty unprofessional.   Everyone else in the salon was very aloof and unfriendly. Some guy kept walking by and giving me weird looks. And lastly, since they are an Aveda salon, they are supposed to (as every other Aveda salon I've been to has, and as advertised on their website) give you little freebies like a cup of herbal tea, a little neck massage, etc. I got nothing, not even an offer for a glass of water. This may seem petty, but if I'm spending $150 and an hour and a half to get my hair done, I'd like to at least be offered a glass of water.  If you go, make sure you check out the website first and specifically request a stylist you like. Go early so you can deal with the parking. And BYOB(everage) ;)
85Psu1j4oaTSkUeMk5WNOw : When you are craving American-Chinese food this is the best place in the area. They are fast, cheap, and tasty. My husband almost always gets the white meat General Tso' and I get any of the vegetable/tofu dishes. They offer free egg roll with orders of a certain amount.  Be sure to get the crab rangoons! YUM!
6QXiQ4h1Y_fF0i104RH6DQ : Need packaging tape/pens/bowl and don't want to walk one block further to Walgreens because 1) It costs 6$/roll 2) you'd have to wait in line forever 3) you hate that limited crappy walgreens and something traumatic always happens when you go?  WHERE DO YOU GO? DAISO!  I must admit at first, when I was in dire need of packaging tape I figure "No thats a gyp joint and I don't want to be sucked into that trap" but overcame my fear and entered. YES on the tape and so many other things you need to furnish a shitty studio apartment.   So no, not just knick-knacks.  1. Their basic hair barrettes are good quality.  2. Adjustable curtain rods for 2-3$. On amazon they are 25!  3. They have things you find your self needing that would otherwise cost at 3x as much anywhere else - like stationary, tweezers, mug.   So thank you Daiso for helping me save money but also tempting me with junk...but that's ok. The kids who work there are pretty friendly and really helpful which is nice since that is not the service you get at 99 cents only store. You cannot make returns. And you must your cash [only] in a small tray (curious...). But I think, culturally, bringing cash back into circulation, reminds me of my childhood.
g7AzSEi2JtS-Ps5H2qojvg : If you can deal with the teeny tiny space and a potential battle over outdoor seating, this place is wonderful.    The food is order-yourself authentic portions of panini, salads, and other creative specials.
8HHbHEemXi4eAf-5tfwY1Q : I was recently on campus again for an alumni event.  On average, the girls have great personalities and intelligence.
UdRqA9H2iAObMCFhuVVf5Q : Tastes ok, I wish the bread was naan... or if it's supposed to be naan, I wish it was fluffier. I think it's a bit overpriced for the petite size.
VGwJhxANL6dxJhy8iBAhHw : Came here one morning for breakfast because my friend had no food in her apartment! Oh the horror.   I just got a 8oz. drip coffee, no sugar or cream. I like my coffee black and not sweet, which is really odd because I love sweets. To compliment the dark and yummy bitterness of the coffee I got a banana walnut bread and man was it delicious. I'm not sure if they make their own bread but I really enjoyed how thick and dense the bread was. I dipped it into the coffee occasionally because it was just so good together. The sweetness of the banana and the crunch of the walnuts went well with the hot coffee. Their coffee was quite good. Definitely better than the crap they sell at Starbucks.
79CJgFamtHpfBDC_K1vl3w : They have some of the best root beer that I have ever had in my life.  Gotta get it in a frosted mug.  As for the rest of the food it's about average for a hot dog and burger joint.  I usually get a footlong cheese coney...it goes great with that awesome root beer.
w-ztDvufpACnWWsg2CqihA : Apparently under new management, not to imply I knew it when it was under old ownership, but it does put the reviews before me into context. Me and a buddy ordered delivery today. We both got large subs, him a buffalo chicken, me chicken parmesan. Inexplicably, the thing I remember most was the bread, which is not to imply that the things contained within the bread were not delicious, but it may have been the best sub bread ever. It was perfectly hot, soft and perfect for the subs. My sub was great, the cutlet was good and there was just enough sauce, although by proxy of a stolen bite, I regret not getting the buffalo chicken, which was epic. Also, they have a bunch of coupons on their site and campus live, which got us a free small pizza with the subs. The pizza was good, but didn't have enough sauce. Its a small sample size to judge (literally) but I would say think twice about the pizza. But the subs? The fucking namesake???  Yeah, order those.
b2vZURG_fWZ2GgaZSyWcPA : Pretty good, for the Ave. It's fried and salty - not exactly healthy - but can hit the spot. The base prices are a bit high but there's a good amount of food and there are often specials, plus there's a punch-card if you eat there frequently. I've only tried the fish and chips and chowder, but both were good. The hush puppies were a nice touch. The couple of times I've been here, it's been pretty empty, so it was a bit awkward to sit and eat.
9V1awcvKcX6mTLCnRuXzrQ : A FTR of a Food Truck in Austin?  NO WAY.  Stolen.  This stuff is amazing.  Korean and Vietnamese in a food truck.  Yeah I know it's been done before, but never done quite this good.  Prices are fair, comes out fast, and it's delicious!  I really did wish this truck was around when I was at college.  Then again maybe not cause if this truck around I wouldn't be able to say I USED to be skinny in college.   Glad to have another addition of great food trucks in Austin.  Hopefully it will be a matter of time that Houston can step to the same level.
7Dcg1sFP7by5YN8z4CMT-A : It's my watering hole for watching CAL Bears Football and Basketball on the TVs.
BHpwaSrCbZCzX748BH4SkQ : This is a wonderful place for made-in-front-of-you Italian samwiches. They also have all sorts of cool food stuffs imported from the motherland. As my mama mia would say "Molto squisito!"
BZYqTeqwb9gG_LSvorK3og : Floating Rock serves pretty average food. Beef in Loc Lac was overdone and the fried fish with ginger was nice but nothing too special.   Services was horribly inattentive. Ten minutes to come to the table.   I'd never make a night out of coming to Floating Rock. Its the type of place for something easy or carry out.
P5wNVZrf9Xzoe6MeGAyKkg : It's just OK.  The food makes me think it should be part of a chain.  Think Chi-Chi's or Olive Garden level of cuisine.  Large portions, heavy on the dairy.  The atmosphere is good if you want some place high-energy, and, if you want to hole up at home, their take-out service is really fast.
B-AhLYPW-NoOGDjw4s-vhA : This restaurant is closed.
eHMwd_-yvSbGtCdhAR2dmg : I met up with a friend in U Village on a Tuesday night, and we came in here looking for a cheap happy hour menu.  They had a good selection of appetizers under $5 and $3 draft beers.  I wasn't too impressed with the caesar salad we split - it was drowning in dressing! - but everything else was good.  Warm pita with tasty hummus.  My friend "splurged" on the salmon cakes (~$15), which were rich and filling.  They came with two cakes to an order, though I think one would have been plenty.  We couldn't finish it between the two of us.  Our tab came to just under $50 for food and a couple drinks each, not a bad deal.  The downside was that this place was really noisy and full of kids.  Our server seemed busy and distracted at times.  There were also these REALLY irritating bugs flying around our heads that reminded us of fruit flies on steroids... we killed no fewer than five during the two hours we sat there, but they just kept on coming.  Ack.  I wouldn't rush back in here for HH - pretty sure there are other places in the area that would be equally good if not better - but it was fine for one evening.
FhfTFaxOa37cchzeJ6rFuA : Um, did I walk into the right place?  I can't believe people say this is their favorite place to eat--dingy space, spotty service, marginally acceptable food, the only reason I'd go back is if I'm really short on cash.  I got the Western omelette, it was basically a pile of veggies stir-fried with egg on the bottom, my friend's Eggs Benedict was just plain bad.  Not even the home fries were good.  I think the highlight of the meal was the buttered toast, and they also ran out of OJ when I went.  All in all, I'd rather go to Sunny's Diner than this place!
2iYbCuh-VefCYIIOTL2MLg : deliciously delicious I got heir all the time.
qyZnoIcg_WK2j8t93gHUog : Old school ice cream busting with flavor and choices. They also make their own cookies, and toppings. As soon as I saw the cones with chocolate hard had I was sold. I could not finish the whole cone as I was full from lunch, but the few bites from the chocolate covered cone made me a true believer in Bert& Rocky's  Will be stopping by again, and again , and again
7lyxWTZDFvQYhHkMUUexvQ : Shannon has a life long client in me...   I've been a client of Shannon's for several years now. Shannon is AMAZING at her craft. I say craft because not many people can do what Shannon does. Not only is she very knowledgeable, she provides TOP NOTCH customer service. She's warm and inviting. I appreciate the fact that she listens to my concerns and takes the time to explain what she's doing and what I can do to keep my skin as healthy and radiant as possible.   I've not only taken advantage of Shannon's skin care services. I have used her makeup services as well. Shannon has done my makeup for at least five special occasions. The first time Shannon did my makeup was for a friend's Wedding. When my Mother saw me she said she had never seen me look more beautiful than I did that day. I have referred friends to Shannon and they to have been just as pleased with her as I am.   I also appreciate that booking a appointment with her is so simple, time gets away from me so being able to go to her website 24/7 is a very pleasant convience.   Thank you for the excellent service you provide. YOU ROCK!!!
9emN6M4kQYNlpO0RyDRoyw : My initiatiion into Indian food came years ago thanks to Kabob and Curry.  The food here is amazing and very varied.  Read up on the place--you'll find spicy flavors balanced about by fruity/sweet dishes influence by Kashmiri food.    I've never ever been disappointed--the last time I went I actually brought two chefs with me and they reveled in the experience.  If you've never had Indian before, get yourself to Kabob and Curry.
0aRfQUQgvakgWRGwIY04Vg : One of the better chicken sandwiches within walking distance from the UC campus. I always ask for Rosemary Garlic Chicken with Honey Wheat with a side salad and Italian dressing. They bake their own sandwich bread, 3, sometimes 4 kinds of it. Plus, the portions are HUGE, so for 5-6 bucks you get a meal that will get you through the afternoon.  Also, the Berkeley Salad with chicken was very tasty and they most thoughtfully, as always, put the dressing on the side. No one likes soggy salad.  UPDATE: Take advantage of the 3 for 2 special. Buy any 2 sandwhiches and get the third for free. Who doesn't like free yummy food. :)
taJKSwR-VSE65BHc2i0RXQ : Fantastic pasta. (One of the few alfredo dishes I've had that doesn't make me sick.) Great waiters. BYOB option. Lovely atmosphere where you'll probably fit in wearing jeans or evening wear. AMAZING almond torte!
VMB4jKlE9ZTF8DNe9EJIng : I LOVE COOKIES! their cookies are absolutely delish & cheap (3 for $1.. and wayyy better than most like Mickey D's). i try to stop by & grab some whenever I'm out on the westside.   i also LOVE cookie sandwiches on hot days, which there are a lot of in LA! For $1.50, choose any 2 cookies you want and one flavor.. you can go classic or make your own fantastic creation to your palette's liking, really can't go wrong!   tip: if you're getting ice cream or a cookie sandwich, you don't have to wait in that long line of ppl just getting cookies.. move to the right of it and go straight towards the ice cream. oh and also it's CASH ONLY so come prepared.  ENJOY!
HjSyQSDGBRpcnQnTWZVjXA : Changed the Swiss Bliss burger to a Cheddar Bliss, and it was excellent.  There's something about the salty tang of butter on a coffee cake.  Guava juice excellent.
m_DW4NZeOPpIE-TWUBnYRw : Okay, so this place is amazing when it comes to final, midterms, or taking a break from the library.   I really like the paninis cause they always taste good. But the vinaigrette dressing can be a bit acidic at times but it's still good nevertheless.  Their black bottom muffin, biscotti, and espresso brownie bar are my stable.  The only reason why I took away 1 star is because the Italian soda is not that great and it's always crowded with a bijillion people during normal school year.
PDKtBpZNmvaWfVfF6nxblg : Who doesn't love a Cherry On Top?!?!?!?!  This place is delicious, great toppings, and great yogurt choices that are always switching so you can always try something new!  The place is usually busy, no matter what hour of the night you might be there, oh and my favorite thing about this place is how late they are open. Til 11pm during the week days and 12-1 on weekends. I also love that they give you a rewards card so you get your 10th one free!  So if you're looking for a sweet treat late a night and you're in the Pasadena area have a Cherry On Top!!!
aimDI3REm-Z4Xvau_UNlGg : I had my Istanbul Grill experience last night (Sunday) and the place very easily gets added to my list of places in HTown I would recommend for Turkish food. It might very well got right to the top of the list.  Okay so that was the opening to set the context and now is the nit-picking part. So let me start with what worked for me. 1. The food was delicious. The menu is very traditional Turkish with some dishes that I have not seen elsewhere. I tried the Sultani Kebab and the Lamb Seekh kebab and both of them got really high points on taste from both my friend and me. I also liked the salted yogurt (ayran) though all in all that might be because of my Indian roots. We ended it all traditional Turkish coffee and one quick recommendation here would be if you like sugar in your coffee then go for the medium sugar as the folks are really generous with sugar. It would definitely not win a lot of points on presentation but then is that is what your expecting then my pointer would be to the price and also would suggest that come on get a little serious. 2. The ambiance of the place was very family owned store like and was not at all pretentious. The place was fairly packed for a Sunday night. 3. The service was friendly and it added to the turkish feel of the place. They were very happy to make recommendations and also to double check on how you preferred things. 4. The location of the place is awesome and makes it just a short walk to go grab some drinks after dinner.  What could be problem with the place: 1. As it is located bang in the middle of West U parking on a busy night could be a pain and you might have to circle around a bit.
th_gfm7u_pPHwnhYjJxU1w : The story of the creation of this place on the menu indicates that it was built from the ground up by some college dudes in New Jersey. I'd be willing to put money on the fact that they were ridonkuously drunk (and maybe high) at the time. Really, how else would someone come up with the idea to put all of the worst foods for you, EVER onto a philly style sandwich and to name them all with the word "phat" in the title? Wow.  I'd never in a million years envisioned myself eating a sandwich topped with cheesesteak, chicken fingers, gyro meat, mozzarella sticks, french fries & statziki sauce (the "Phat Phillipino")... but it happened. Only because they deliver to my work and they deliver quite quickly, even though we were told it'd be about 30 minutes, I think they arrived in 15. As if the sandwich weren't enough, I ordered some mac and cheese bites (I'm a sucker for mac and cheese, if you didn't know) and was asked if I'd like them ON my sandwich or on the side.  By the way, they also do pizzas and calzones, salads, burgers, cold subs, wraps, wings, and breakfast sandwiches (at all times of the day!) and are open until 4am. You see? Drunk/munchie/hangover food.  Besides the odd combination of things and the artery clogging, my sandwich was far from memorable. I doubt that I'll order from them again.  I'm sure my high cholesterol will appreciate the favor.
Kjk7pmGXJYcEvqdFCFmpOg : I'm becoming a little disenchanted by Thai Spice.  That's not to say that I no longer eat here, but I've noticed that the chicken is dry more and more often when I order it.  This is not just in the yellow curry.  It's also true of the taste of ginger chicken and the peanut chicken.  The other stuff we order (spring rolls and that soup with coconut milk and mushrooms) is very good, but the chicken is dry even in a very saucy meal like yellow curry.
70LoM_QHyMjkp5XUm-Heag : Their 11:30am-2:00pm take-out lunch offer is a very good deal for the thrifty and starving among the Columbia students, perhaps the cheapest food in Manhattan: for $5 you'll get a decent portion of (brown/white/fried) rice along with three sides of your own choice (a variety of stir-fried meats and vegetables, and deep-fried rolls, but watch out for the bones in meats - I like their lemongrass honey chicken and broccoli chicken). Finally, you'll get to pick a passable but hearty soup (eggdrop is okay, huge wontons are nice but the meat inside is clearly not grade A, chicken noodle soup is extremely rich but greasy).   Don't be afraid of the queue, they're fabulously efficient. The food tends to be greasy, but better than in most similar places.
-rCfWogTK52SPGBUyaEe7g : I used to go here when I was a grad student with my profs (1976-78). It made us feel cooler than the undergrads. You can meet some of the smartest people on the planet there. Maybe a little "quirky" though. It used to smell like urine, so we sat outside on grass and under the trees, hoping the latest attempts had gotten rid of the Grackles.
f9b1qBgR_Kfh1ukmztu8Jg : The first time I've been here was based on reccomendations from a co-worker. I pass by this place walking along Gayley all the time, but never walked in. First time, i ordered a burger wowshi. It took a bit long to get it because it's baked to order. Totally worth the wait. They cut it in half for you, so it's like you have two pita meals! I loove the dressing bar. All the hummus, lettuce, and etc you want. They started charging for the fried cauliflowers, but totally worth the extra charge. They are soo good. It's been awhile since I've been back, and need to go visit soon.
OXTyNCRY6u0kyWnrnzSMyg : For all the hype that I've heard about Legal, I would say that it is an overpriced, pretentious seafood restaurant. I came here with some girlfriends for our first night in Boston during a convention. 4 out of 5 of us ordered a 1 lb lobster, thinking that it would be the best lobster we've ever had. I just have to say that $32.95 for a steamed lobster is a total rip-off, even if it comes with 2 sides (and according to our waiter, you CAN substitute one of the sides for clam chowder - which I recommend because most of the sides are not very appealing). But just dipping the lobster in butter for taste does not do justice for a $33 meal. We later found out that you can get a whole lobster elsewhere in Boston for only $12.   The 2 sides I got were mashed potatoes and clam chowder (as mentioned). The mashed potatoes were dry; but the clam chowder was pretty good. I hear the fish is supposed to be good, but I tried a few bites of one of the other girls' fish n chips too. Unimpressive.   In conclusion: the lobster is not worth it, the fish n chips unimpressive. Everything is overpriced. Will not come back.
aWAaq59zD0mw5JW5tAhgSQ : love arni's!!!!!!!!!!!! love the bbq pizza!!! love the blue cheese dressing on junior salads & with chips
5mGOjYMglC3sSi7QfvgogQ : Not that great in terms of food. The beer's OK but not always perfect. The men's room urinal is a godsend, with a vent of nice cool air that is just at face level.
z4gFNEQkXiYKtvRvIjBw0g : From the beginning to the end, this place was amazing. The staff at the desk is very friendly and hospitable and seems to genuinely care that you are well taken care of. Upon check-in, there was a pretty big variety of free DVD rentals with some pretty recent titles. There are two ice machines on the property which was a nice perk for those carrying an ice chest in their cars like we were.  My boyfriend and I stayed in the Plantation room 626. The room was beautiful. It came with a California King sized bed, a microwave, a fridge, a coffee maker (with enough coffee for two pots full, hot chocolate, tea, sugar, and creamer!), two hair blow dryers, a magnified mirror, a huge shower big enough for two, and HD directv with HBO. Not to mention free wi-fi.  There are a couple of reasons why I didn't rate this place 5 stars. First, there were noises that sounded like water was draining almost all night long. I'm not sure if it was the air conditioner or the fridge, but it was a bit of a disturbance when you're used to sleeping in silence. Secondly, we were quoted a rate of $169 and signed for a rate of $169, but upon checkout we were surprised with a $20 add-on for taxes. Most people assume there will be taxes on any type of good or service, but it seemed a bit shady that they didn't quote the tax upfront. And $20 seems like a bit much on a $169 room.. 11.8% tax? Lastly, the breakfast in the morning was a bit of a hassle. When we got there a full hour before they stopped serving, we were quickly informed that they had just gotten a big rush and were trying to restock because of it; also, that there was a waitlist that would take longer to wait in than they were going to be open. Our only options were to either sit at a table with another group of people or to take our food to our room. We chose to take our food to our room. The food was cooked to order; I had french toast and my boyfriend had bacon and eggs. There were bagels and fresh fruit, and the best part: Starbucks coffee.  The staff at this bed and breakfast really seem to care about your stay. The few hiccups that happened during our stay wouldn't prevent me from coming back, but they were minor annoyances that should probably be fixed.
eNXqyvjFdGQLpdW0NHY-Uw : The store has all the basics and the nicer brands of strollers like Bugaboo but the selection is very limited. It's a good place to stop by and pick up something you need immediately but the small selection makes it a limited shopping experience.   The staff is hot and cold. They seem to get overwhelmed easily and can't handle a crowd. I went in once and the sales person who was supposedly  lead sales could not tell me how the Peg Perego infant car seat fit into the matching Pilko3 stroller. She was friendly and earnest but not knowledgeable enough to be "lead sales".   I went in the other day looking for a safety device and could not find someone to help me. I eventually found the item myself and went to the cash register to pay for it. When I walked up the sales person was on the phone and kept taking calls. There was another sales person standing behind her just looking at me. So I started to walk away and accidentally knocked a small display of business cards over. I apologized and started my attempt to pick them up. She became extremely snotty and insisted on picking up the small display but did it with such attitude that I wanted to ask her if it was really worth it.   Please keep in mind that I am 38 weeks pregnant and can't even see my own feet or tie my own shoelaces. The last thing any customer needs is someone to give them attitude over an accident.   There is a new store called Giggle which should be opening soon on Lake St. I think they're going to give The Right Start a run for their money.   UPDATE: The Right Start has filed for chapter 11. Go figure.
9Mo-Fp1uIue6ZtZ0NJbYdw : Amazing food for a great value.  The service is a little slow but the waitstaff are super sweet--and knowing they make a living wage can certainly help one develop the patience of a saint. It fills up fast so finding a table can be tricky. Club Passim next door provides a cute, alcohol free night spot alternative.
QuECkimm2G1eN78Ni2ddXA : Super cute restaurant on the outskirts of the hustle and bustle of Old Town Pasadena.  I like that you can come here and not worry about parking.  We ordered the salmon lettuce wraps for appetizer and it was lemony and refreshing.  Our entrees were the garlic string beans and pad see ew with beef.  Both are tasty and the perfect combination of flavors.  The noodles in the pad see ew were really stuck together though, but the beef slices were thin and tender (not too chewy).  They have a very large menu teas, but since it was so hot out, I decided to just go with a glass of iced roasted barley tea.  I would definitely suggest to go early because the place definitely got to be really busy when we were done around 7:30 pm.  Overall, an intimate restaurant with good service and fresh food.  Would go back soon :)
fxyIB_hTr_Y8Fo_u_kU1nA : Definitely the Wednesday tradition. Most of the courses are pretty good. Every once in a while they have some misses - beware of the white yougurty sauce. It's definitely the dessert that jeeps me coming back for more - even if it is just fancy cream of wheat.
U-uNzbMBS2MLxAY-wrRdXQ : I dragged my parents there kicking and screaming.  They're not as excited to try new places as I am.  Well I have to say, my dad would not leave the restaurant before he could complement the manager on such a fine restaurant.  He doesn't do that often.  The restaurant is a well-decorated gem nestled in on a street that you could call 'the rough."   The decor is like nothing here in Philadelphia.  Masks, cars, wicker booths, and live music all make this place visually/audibly unforgettable. Now, don't come here if you want 1. traditional mexican food  2. cheap food  or 3. an unshareable single platter of food.  The best way to describe this place is "it's exactly like Tinto, wildly nontraditional with small plates to share except that it's with a Mexican flair."  We did the tasting, plus chips and guacamole.  We were overfull.  There was nothing we did not like.  We had so many different flavors coming to our table.  Everything from the drunken beans, skewered scallops, truffled mushroom with cuitlachoche, fish tacos (Mmm...), Caso Fundito, Carne Asada and just amazing dessert was unforgettable and unique and delicious.  Do NOT forget to get dessert.  Also, don't forget to get a Margarita or a special Mexican drink.  We ordered drinks with fresh watermelon, and it would be worth the trip just for those drinks.  All-in-all, apparently we loved it.  My dad even said he'd go back, which is indeed rare.
FMQQedBFhu66hRcj1xhOoA : So glad Kara's now carries mini cupcakes! I love sweet vanilla but that huge mound of frosting on the regular size cupcake is too guilt inducing...now the mini version is just right! Also love the peanut butter ganache with chocolate cake - soooo delicious and a mini size is two bites so it's perfect! I meant to take one bite and save hubby the other. But there was no way to stop my mouth from devouring the second half once the party got started!!  Yummm!!
JfYFxwVIclP7VbrZ7_D8zw : Nice pool. Very friendly staff. Awesome!!!!
MnVh-Om1WZWZvUvAMyU0UA : Eye Place Optometry has proved to be a wonderful little discovery, thanks to Yelp. Dr. Vipapan did a thorough examination and offered some insights on my eyes, glasses, contacts, etc.  The cost for the eye exam and contact lens fitting was quite reasonable.  Dr. Vipapan is a "real doctor" ... as opposed to just an eyeglasses/contacts salesman, which is what you see in some other places.   I felt like I was being treated like his patient, not just another customer.  The rest of the staff, including Mindy, are also great. Friendly and helpful.  Although I have not yet bought any, they have a very nice selection of frames to choose from.
suI4-icyqB5RS8Obl4b-8Q : Dear Hai Ky Guadalupe,  Although you're cut from the same thread as the love of my life, Hai Ky Oltorf, you are very, very different my friend.   First off, you don't have chicken broth pho. What's up with that? Secondly, the chicken that you do put in your pho is dark meat. The Oltorf location has chicken broth AND white meat.   Why do you refuse to conform? The Oltorf Hai Ky is obviously the middle child - you know, always had to share so it's humble and not the baby so mommy and daddy are no longer enabling your irresponsibility. Yes, that must be why we get along so well.
9aSMJ5L7MoOkc5SLthDQqQ : We were new in town and found this place thanks to Yelp's 4 star reviews!  I find Matsuri pretty authentic with some modern twist. Miso soup, and all the nigiri's we ordered were tasty and fresh. One particular plate that stood out for me was the sea urchin (uni), they were so fresh and delicious!! That might be one of the best sea urchins that I've had!  Speaking of modern twist, we ordered the seaweed salad, and it came in a very large bowl with mix salad rather than seaweed salad. Yes there were some seaweed in it but mainly mixed salad. We didn't mind it because it tasted very good.    A special dish that I ordered from the "menu" on the wall was the almond shrimp tempura. It was out of curiosity on my part and I'm glad I tried it, it was also very good and different from the usual shrimp tempura. Matsuri was definately one of the better restaurants we tried in Pasadena.
iw7-drh9eod-S86XarKryw : Yummy pasta but a little too oily for my taste. I bought a calzone to-go once and opened the giant cake box (those things are huge!) to find it covered in oil. Not exactly appetizing... Still, I think it's one of the best places in Berkeley to get pasta/Italian-style food because it's considerably cheaper than other alternatives!
OBJPnvCfJ-hdqjJ8MnSvXg : oh FSM with their dim ass lighting, yet somehow even during non-midterm/finals season hordes of college students sit and study/read/youtube.  the outdoor seating is okay, although Berkeley is pretty chilly most days to actually enjoy the outdoor seating.  i always go for the quick, and overpriced costco croissants.  recently i discovered the chocolate cake which is actually pretty heavenly. seriously it's like putting a chocolate cloud in your mouth.
GDce6C5c2ESExhN7M0VdxQ : There's nothing really special here.  The service is slow at the bar and the tables, the place is crowded with Affliction/Ed Hardy T-shirt wearing type guys.  The music is truly terrible dance-pop nonsense.  The food is forgettable without being bad: think Chilis or Outback.    On the plus side, they do have some good beers available.  But this is Pittsburgh, and that's not unusual at all.  In fact, you can walk a few blocks, say to Bites and Brews or Harris Grill and get an even better selection, usually for the same price or better.
_D01MBF80MKyJjHCFKOybg : Huge slices of course, but its better to have them plain. If you ask for a topping, they pull out some toppings from the fridge and sprinle them over a plain slice and stick it back into the overn for 3 minutes. End result is that the toppings never have a well-cooked, part-of-the-pizza taste. Stick to the plain slices.
Go2eHj5DjRLEVcxqbxPx6Q : Next to Green Street, parking validated in the structure, and decor is very sparse.  Cold, metal chairs, grey/silver decor, outside seating, menu gives you so many choices it's almost too much!  They do have pre-designed burgers if it's just too much, salads, chicken, grilled cheese, fries, sweet potato fries (yum), shakes, beers... Music playing was pretty good. Burgers were pretty good, and we'll probably go back some time.
JbPy57WpcUx508PBmKh73Q : Best falafal sandwich I've ever had! Messy, but so good.
VbTNtyttYtSDnYdFNY260Q : It's so hard finding a good Thai place in Boston after living on the west coast.   Unlike the normal west coast restaurants I missed, they don't ask you how spicy you want it.  So often times, I got a non-spicy noodle dish because I forgot to ask for 3 star-spice!
JXWjXX6tDW5tzT6a3oCukQ : SOOOOOO...........DELICIOUS!!!  Sometimes I put on a few lbs and this is one of the reasons why :).  Does anybody remember the perfectly golden, air-light, goodness of old Duncan Hines milk chocolate chip cookies  (wiping the drool from my chin)?  Well, this is the closest thing I have tasted to my childhood fav that are no longer made.  For $1.50, you get a customized ice cream sandwich of any 2 big, fresh baked cookies and scoop of ice cream. This place deserves 10 stars!
20vC0i3O7rvor6GfwfVF3w : I'm shocked by so many good reviews. I went to see Sherman about 10 months ago and couldn't believe how they operated. I have since gotten my second opinion with Harmony Dental and had a great experience there. http://www.yelp.com/biz/harmony-dental-group-la-jolla#hrid:55e0IS7q5PCmUZVvwFzLng  So this is how it went with Sherman:  1. Sit me in stage 1 of the "dental factory" to the far left where I was interrogated about my life habits by a no-humor/no-rapport technician. 2. I move a bit more to the right, where they FORCE me to watch a movie about periodontal disease. Weird? 3. A very moody hygienist starts poking my gums and shouting out Three, Four, Two, Five, etc 4. Suddenly I have periodontal disease 5. Right after that, they clean my teeth... with ONLY a ultrasound water cleaning instrument. They don't use a scraper! Wtf?? My teeth were barely cleaned at all, but things were moving so fast, I didn't even want to bring it up. More on that later. 6. More poking in my teeth as the Hygienist finds 3 cavities (which after my second opinion at Harmony turn out to be nothing) 7. Dr. Sherman, who does seem like a very nice man, comes in, compliments my teeth, and reluctantly agrees with the hygienist that I need to get those cavities possibly filled. Up to me. :roll-eyes: 8. I get the bill. Even with my insurance, they want $600+ For the periodontal cleaning, fillings, and whatever else they came up with. 9. After asking why they only cleaned my teeth with the ultrasonic water thingy, they said "Oh we will give you the full cleaning when you come in for your ($600) periodontal cleaning :) "  Notice the smile :). That was the only smile I got all day.  Horrible experience. It is a farm, they are VERY confident people, seem like they know what they are doing. Maybe Sherman minored in psychology because he somehow convinced many people to give him good reviews. Cognitive dissonance after that can leave someone convinced their experience was "professional" and "standardized" even though it wasn't.   Don't let the factory dental farm trick you! Get a second opinion if you feel something isn't right. Harmony Dental proved to me I had only 1 cavity and they scraped my teeth---they even gave me a free teeth scrapping when I came back a month later for a quick follow up.  Make sure your dentist treats you with respect, like a human, and your dental office isn't a conveyor belt.  Good luck..
1pe8TCKwrbK9s7QUjTfACA : Yawn!  We went here before the Fox for some quick pick ups and a good glass of wine.  While the wine was certainly good, it was wayyy over priced.  It was certainly not a fifteen dollar glass of wine.  Also, the food was horrible.  We had some prawns which were soaked in a bland cream sauce that tasted horrible.  We also had a pizza that was dry as a bone and overcooked.  I tried the seafood salad which was a fried bunch of mess.  The seafood was over-fried and dried out.  It was way too greasy and it just did not taste good.  The best part of the meal was the bread that was provided free of charge.  The service was horrible too.  We had three different waiters come and take our orders and half of them got it wrong.  Just skip this place!
bygZ_BWR0ULIFWOBy9gQMg : This location is probably the worst Walgreens I've ever gone to. It's right off campus so they get a lot of business from UCB students and faculty, but they never have enough employees for checkout, even though there are plenty of open unstaffed registers. I go there a lot for milk and groceries and 50% of the time I walk down there, the milk is out of stock. This is a problem with a lot of items at this location. Someone in management needs to get replaced. It's ridiculous to sit in line for so long when it's obvious that this place will always be busy from all the students. The register operators say, "I see three" when there is more than three people in line and someone is supposed to come out and assist with checkout. Pretty soon I'm going to start getting on the intercom system and saying, "I see three" as soon as I enter the store just so I can check out by the time I get my groceries from the back. Bah. Ridiculous. I hope someone from the company reads these posts. Still, I'm glad that the Walgreens is there because I'm tired of all this garbage I hear about people in Berkeley not wanting large store chains in Berkeley. One of the worst factors of this city is that there are few large chains, and instead we have these lousy mom-and-pops places that sell useless overpriced junk. This whole city is in serious need of overhaul.
s12dzcCrGuASHQoOQJjjLg : Let me start off by saying the paninis are 900+ calories and they aren't even that great. They use high-gluten flour and everything is so high in sodium. The pizzas are okay, and the tiramisu is watery and not decadent.  Only reason I give it 2 stars if because the gelato is marvelous! Cookie Sensation is amazing.  And since it's a place for us students, I'm digging the beverages choices they have.
8Zv6t7MWSiybSpa5jMdy5w : I would eat at this place every time I go to work and get a lunch break, except for the fact that it's fairly pricey for a quick meal.   "What's your prescription?" so ask their menus. The first step is to pick-a-protein (chicken or salmon), the second step is to say-a-sauce (I prefer the Vinaigrette or Dill Yogurt), and the last step is to select-a-side, which are all very very good.   The place is called Dr. Grubb's for the fact that their meals are supposed to be healthy and not filled with fried goodies. Their meat is very flavorful at the same time, so it's not something you'll regret! And I definitely don't feel lethargic after eating their food.. which I feel often after I eat "unhealthy" food, from where I go straight into food-coma and may not recover from. Which definitely does not make my bosses more fond of me.   This place is a healthy, yummy and satisfying pick! =)
yfzQUqIuMAJGx4XCY7eh3A : THE best pizza in The county, and I am a HuGe fan of the small grocery shop next door, my Grandma Anne would have approved :-)  Closed on Sundays though.
VlH1fNyDwVS4ZmmzovDkOw : For all the hype of this place, I expected an orgasm in a sandwich, topped with bacon and chocolate and a bikini-clad Jessica Alba. Sadly, I received none of those in my visit to Zingerman's.  My two friends and I get here around 7 in the evening and there's a line of 20 ahead of us, all gazing upward at the massive menu and the walls of cheese and meats. Once we get upfront, I'm slightly shocked at the balls of someone who wants to charge $14 for a sandwich from a deli without any special service. But it's so highly touted that I get a reuben and then take a seat. The food comes out in maybe 10-15 minutes and while I am waiting, I peruse the equally overpriced chocolates, desserts, and other paraphernalia that Mr. or Mrs. Zingerman has decided to include in his or her empire of food.  The sandwich is nothing special although it is quite large (and if you're going to get one, spring $2 for the bigger size - worth it). The meat was good - but this was by no means a New York Jewish deli quality meal. The bread was soft (and a bit soggy) and it frankly did not wow me.  My companions opted to try some dessert - again, overpriced, equally disappointing cakes.   I really wanted to like this place but it just didn't happen. Sad.
BjxuLowpr_--gO1ocC3NWA : Unless you're interested in history, stay out. In fact, just stay out anyway. It's just a quad. And not the best place to hang, even if it did provide some nice scenery on the way to Harvard Square and beyond. I always liked JFK park better, anyway.  I think I did rub the toe once, though.
U3itIzQoNBS3CfaMQ7CDQg : Excellent breakfast.  A friendly place where the seat you as fast as they can and serve you as well as they can.  It is a great spot.  The pancakes are off the charts!
uuIcTizm-Maxe31Lwzs71Q : When I came here, I lived in a hotel for a month until I found an apartment.  My castmate Amy and I scoured every online apartment search engine, Craigslist, and newspapers to find decent deals on living arrangements.  While she was cool with a roommate situation, I needed a small studio for a decent price, in a relatively safe area, where I could park and not have to deal with Atlanta highway traffic on the way to work.  My answer?  710 Peachtree.  Ultimately, my stay here has been pretty good.  I'm not extremely picky, as I have moved 14 times in the past 10 years for college and theatre work, so I've lived in all kinds of strange places - but this time, I wanted a place of my own that would be at least comfortable enough for the run of this show.  Price/space: I have one of the smallest studios, which actually isn't that small at all, especially for one person.  I got a deal on the rent because they were running a special, which is great, so I am paying $115 less each month than if I had moved in under the regular lease price.    There is plenty of room here in the main room for my queen sized bed, my computer desk,  my large dresser, my instruments, and my little loveseat that Patrick purchased for me at IKEA.  The kitchen is just a walk-in, with a downsized refrigerator and stove (with oven, yay!), but there is a counter on one side with an open view of the main room, and limited but present counterspace on either side of the sink.  There are plenty of cabinets, though I am short and not able to use the ones over the fridge.  There's a decent sized bathroom, with a full-sized bathtub and shower, and under-the-sink storage.  Across the hall, there's a gigantic walk-in closet, with built in shevles over the clothes hanging area and on the other side, as well.  Plenty of space for my money, for sure.  As for amenities and such, the utilities are fairly inexpensive, which is nice, and I have a praking space in the building, though it took them awhile to get me one, so I had to park at the Georgian Terrace for a month.  There is laundry in the basement, a small gym and BEAUTIFUL sun deck on the 3rd floor, and a Quizno's and convenient store downstairs if I'm hungry or need something small and don't feel like going anywhere.  The mail room is easily accessible and well-lit, right off the fancy-looking main lobby, and also has a FedEx drop.  There's also a computer room with online access, a copier and a printer, and though you can only use it for a half hour at a time and have to take your own paper down if you need to copy or print something, it's really handy if any of your own stuff is out of order.  Security-wise, I have been generally happy.  The building has double key-card access in the front and down in the garage, and there is a concierge on duty 24 hours a day to deal with noise complaints, parking problems, or any questions you might have.  Every once in a while the key-card access gate is up downstairs if it's out of order, but not very often.  So why the 3 star and not a five star rating?  WeIl, while I haven't really felt "unsafe" or uncomfortable here, there have been a few problems.  1. I understand that I live in the South, and that roaches are at times an inevitability.  They do what they can to spray and make sure the little varmints don't get in, but I have had to kill a critter or twenty during my 6 month stay (which I suppose doesn't add up to much, but for a Midwestern girl, that's enough).  Since I've put hot pepper under my sinks and at my door, though, I've seen less of them... and management, especially the new management (who are much better), is always quick to respond if I call.  But bugs?  Minus a star.  2. Also, I have had some interesting experiences with my neighbors.  Upstairs, REALLY loud music for awhile until the complaints finally kept their volume to a reasonable level.  To my left, there is a couple who went through a few rough months of SCREAMING at each other - and the guy's name was Cory, so it was extra annoying because I felt like the shrill woman was screaming at ME, though I certainly wasn't the one who made her worry by staying out late, or pissed her off by not talking about my feelings.  The best, though, was my neighbor on the right, who was noisily arrested in the middle of the night (they broke his door down), never to return.  Special.  Scaryt neighbors?  Minus another star.  Other than those inconveniences, I love my little apartment, and it has served me well.  It's a 5 minute drive or a 15-20 minute walk to work (14th Street Playhouse), it's a block from the Fabulous Fox Theatre, and right smack in the middle of a lot of Midtown weekend fun.  And man, compared to some of the other places I visited for similar prices, this was definitely the classiest, occasional bug, crazy neighbors and all.
NSYxliMwTFxEw8vZqOxo4A : Your typical "bar food" restaurant, although I was pleasantly surprised when I tried to go "healthy" here one time with the "El Pollo Guapo" (grilled chicken sandwich with avocado). The draw of this place is it's a close Rice Village location if you're A) hungry after a few drinks, or B) tired of standing at the Rice Village bars and want a place to sit, chat and catch up with little noise. It's also a plus with a full bar, especially if you're coming from Ginger Man or Little Woodrow's.  The food isn't anything to write home about, but the "home-brewed" beers are pretty good. The big draw is the "Two Rows" beer (think a richer Dos Equis); I'd advise to stay far, far away from the "Jalapeno" beer.  I believe they also validate if you're parking in the garage, which is pretty fantastic on a Friday night.
yaOeW0ZvGCVTz4K7VMw4pg : It's Americanized Thai meaning it's sweet, not spicy, dunno about MSG. Very cute decor: very cafe bistro, or "shabby chic," like Susy H says (Hi Suz!). Friendly and cute waitresses.  - I got the Daisy Mint salad. The plate was an iceberg salad and then had peanut butter spaghetti on top. It was very weird and completely heavy. A few veggies in the peanut sauce but not enough to make my feel better about the peanut butter cream sauce I was inhaling. - I've also had the pad thai. Sweet, not spicy, pretty boring.  - Pad see ew was okay. Again, sweet, not too spicy, pretty boring.  Well, if you like food on the bland side, this place is for you! Daisy Mint is also clean and cute. But if you're looking for real Thai, cheap and dirty, then I'd reco A Taste of Bangkok down the street.
L43vSBvTtzjYmJAEcbszDA : I haven't visited wicked since it's been remodeled, but they had an awesome tattoo section!  Ask for James (if he still works there).  he does awesome work
6qJuDRSTn6BYneNPwixKSQ : i don't think it's necessarily the best policy to rate things on the "well they USED to be" scale, but Porter's has to fall into this category. A few years ago, Porter's was a 2-bit operation that i loved. Rarely was an ID checked, you never paid the same price twice for the same order, and the bartenders knew all the beers backwards and forwards because they were currently drinking most of them. and then the hammer fell. they switched owners, flew those "under new management" banners, and finally replaced the broken fryer which had become the least delicious mascot in history.  but along with the scalding hot oily food came some less finger-licking changes. i don't care what the reason is, i never want to be served any beer in plastic cups unless i'm at a sporting event. that is NOT cool. The prices went up a little, but i understand that they had to, they just weren't charging enough before. The selection is still primo, but i don't like being forced to order 1/2 pints of the good craft beers. I'll pay $10 for a pint of Wee Heavy, i just want the option.   But all in all, despite the changes and the inevitable "It used to be"s, i thank the guys that stepped in and bought the place. the good ole days just couldn't keep marching on.
CkXq2lPTOnyZXGqfRNW84A : Get the chicken shwerma plate, with rice - and ask for the RED hot sauce which'll come on the side.  The baklava is good, but a little excessive with the syrupy glaze.
c24E1Ujplya_c9NidXF4Mw : I asked for a non-smoking room and as soon as I opened the door the masked smell of cigarettes. The service was OK, no major complaints, no major compliments.
oYSGBi4VKLW8F4vX0hI5rw : Yes, the food is good.  But the service sucks.  This doesn't blow the place for me, but you should go in with the head's up.  We had the chicken livers and special salad to begin, both spot on.  And our Maker's Mark Manhattans were pure yum.  The problem was with our burgers.  they were overdone to the point of sending them back.  They are known for the burger and it's a good burger, but even the second time round it was overcooked.  I like being able to doctor with specific toppings, but don't think they don't add up.  That said, all was fresh and hot.  We had fries and mac and cheese and both held up to the hype.  For the neighborhood, this Bistro 18 is a find.  It's definitely worth checking out if you're in the area, say a concert or talk at St. John the Divine's, but not worth traveling to.    Oh, and the happy hour, 3-7pm, looks killer.
T1ZHcoe3z4C4CEO-F30Z-w : I love getting roses and flowers, but I also love to complain that they die too quickly and I only get to enjoy them for three days! When I received a little bouquet of pineapple, melon, grapes, strawberries shaped like flowers, I was static! I didn't even want to share it with anyone!! I was going to get to eat my "flowers" myself! No more complaining about not enjoying them long enough. To my surprise, one person CANNOT eat all that fruit alone! I ended up leaving a lot of it at work. That was at least two years ago. I have used them ever since to send my dad for father's day or anyone who I know would enjoy it. I have never had any issues with delivery, not even when they had to deliver in NY.   Prices are reasonable, as you get a base with the arrangement. I would say that in comparison to what you get, it is a better value. I love the concept of fruit bouquets. I still like flowers and love to get me some roses from time to time, but I can eat fruit any day!   They have physical locations in Houston, however, I usually just go on their site at www.ediblearrangements.com. If you have not yet used them, do! Your significant other, mom, dad, sister, friend will thank you!
pVUmMXIfU_qp6Oi5KZH1OQ : I ended my New Year's with a stop here at 4 am and I've got to say it made my night that much better!   As if people haven't said it enough: the slices are HUGE! And they were definitely ready for the crowd that morning with some amazing pizza ready to go... and I swear it's not the Tanqueray talking here. Of every slice I've had in this whole country, Koronet has been the best so far.  I'll definitely be coming back here every time I'm back in NY...
TIipRtm7UYsFH6Hx06xvfw : Whatll Ya have When they come from outta town. take em here.  This is a once in a whilw delight . Onion rings yum . Frosted orange.. even the wings are good.. Don't eat his less than every 90 days cuz its NOT low carb.
7doRf1eB9-lI8h4y2hRR_g : This place was great! It's a bit small but the atmosphere, the burgers, and especially the fries were delicious! It kinda reminded me of an old pub.. there's also a nice patio area for outdoor dinning.. if you're in the area, i suggest you pop in! You won't be disappointed.
6TYiByOx34JD7hya6ddRWA : When my son was 5 he began asking to learn how to play the drums.  After a year of his asking, I finally started looking for an instructor.  McGuire Music & Sound was the ONLY place I found that had an instructor who was willing to give lessons to my 6 year old.  The other people I spoke to would not take on students younger than 8.  I am happy to say, my son has been a student at McGuire for a year and a half now and he really enjoys his lessons with Joe!  The staff and instructors are knowledgeable, pleasant, and fun!  If you are looking for a Music Store that will make you feel like part of their 'family', look no further!
R41ZVtthxTWH7PQxApCInw : This is a great bookstore to go to and has a fantastic selection of everything that you'd want but can't find in places like Borders.  It carries used books, so you can also feel good about reusing paper.  I used to only go into Leon's, but after that closed about a month ago I decided to try out Phoenix.  It's got a huge two rooms worth of used books.  Although I did not end up buying anything, I found many things that were of interest.  The place was fairly musty, but what do you expect from a used bookstore?  Anyway, this place is definitely one to check out during your next visit to SLO.
fnVwXgLow46kfN5_fWbr_Q : Good brewpub selection with decent food. Great for tourists and groups.
OFE8WQTVSQnpYJDxCJYgsQ : On my first ever night living in Boston my cosmologist roomie gave me a brief walking tour of Central Sq, we sat down for couscous in Middle East and he flatly proclaimed: "FOR THE MUSIC SCENE, THIS IS THE CENTER OF THE GALAXY"  15 months on and he's only ever been proved right. The scenesters of Boston rotate around this hipsteropolis as if it has a dense mass attracting them without question. At the heart of the system is the Supermassive Blackhole that is Downstairs - a fantastic venue that hosts great shows and serves up enough PBR to form an almost inescapable gravitational pull.  Close to the Event Horizon, several dense Nebulae spawn new hipster stars every second... the spartan upstairs bars, the mediocre dining area, the wonderful Zuzu's, TT the Bear's Place, HiFi Pizza, Brookline Lunch... it's difficult to know where this Galaxy Center begins and ends. With a weak telescope it now appears to stretch across everything from Mary Chung to The Phoenix Landing, such is the dense concentration of hipsters and clove cigarettes permanently occupying the sidewalks and doorways.  (...let me take this analogy a few steps too far)  Recent calculations by cosmologists have predicted an expansion rate that will one day see the center encompass all from Harvest to Middlesex and perhaps even lead to a local mass so dense that it causes the weaker nearby stellar clusters of Allston and Somerville to collapse. Observational astronomers (such as Hana T) have already noted that the gravitational pull at The Middle East is sufficiently strong to withhold a staff of unanimously large-chested women, with only those with slender profiles able to to withstand the forces and come and go as they please. It is even hypothesized by some of the more brave theorists in the community that soon the strength of gravity will only allow for escape those who haven't modded their bicycles to fixed gear.  Just like the center of our real galaxy, it's a beautiful thing to look at, but every now and then I'm glad I live a little away from all the chaos on my own galactic arm of Orion.
ko_VmrWZl7Nxt7FxA6ZCvQ : Tri-Tip sandwich is a MUST HAVE at this place in SLO. I visited my cousin for fun and he took me here and its probably the most delicious food that i've tasted in a while. I added Grilled onions and jack cheese in my order and it was BOMB !   The grilled onion was sweet and it mixed really well with the BBQ sauce and the tri tip. The jack cheese was just melting on top of the tri tip which made it very mouth watering.   Also ordered a basket of fries, beware there is a lot of fries in that basket.   One thing though, i didnt like some of the workers there... but who cares im only here for the food not them so oh well. well if you ever stop by SLO its a must go to place so you can check it out for yourself. THUMBS UP
MFjbOzXqhwtxUgPvtHBf-g : I've never had Sprinkles before. I was in La Jolla on a whim and my friend convinced me to stop and give it a try.   The staff are so nice and they handle the line like pros. Their system is very efficient and they are patient in a throng of screaming children and adults.   I ordered 4 cupcakes and it was $14. A little pricy but what the hell -- it's THE "sprinkles" cupcake! Anyway, I ordered Key Lime, Vanilla Milk chocolate, Black and white, and Peanut butter chocolate.   The packaging, decoration and attention to detail was everything that I would have expected from Sprinkles, but the taste was not. I unfortunately disliked all of them!!  While, I did NOT try their signature red velvet, these tasted too much like "muffins" to me. Bland and with little flavor. Even the frosting wasn't that great. I would not spend this much money on their cupcakes again. In the future I'd rather go to Babycakes.
pceDU4qA_mE-9qbwM0Mwgg : Very cute place.  My sister and I decided to order take out and was told that food would take about 30mins to be ready, but I think it was ready sooner than that..we were happy with the service.  I would've given them a 4 star for ambiance and service, but I'm rating based on the food as well.    We orders: Daisy Mint Noodles Pad See Ew Drunken Spaghetti  The daisy mint noodles were rice noodles with red thai curry.  The curry was good, but I think would've been better with rice.  It was an odd, but possibly acquired taste.  Not bad though.   Pad See Ew was average.  I think I would've been happier if there were more noodles and not drowned with broccoli.  Drunken spaghetti had good flavors, but definitely was not drunk.  It was dry, more like chow mien, but spicy and basilly.
FUA7TQnOCtp9Rrcqc0tJrw : The only reason to ever go here is if you literally can't spare the 3 minutes to walk to the book store.  Prices here are 20% to 300% (not a typo) higher than elsewhere on campus, and the sandwich and salad options are mediocre at best.  Think: soggy croutons and bread, wilted lettuce, salad-dressing mismatches, and other similar horrors.
EG04CmGQKWe_Y_d95mKj0A : Love their clearance items - got a long sleeved shirt for $4. They were also selling hoodies for $15 and some other items for cheap too.  Good selection of trendy shoes.... didn't really find anything else here that I liked...lots of darker colors and had a more sophisticated feel to their style (I'm kinda the opposite type - love color and lots of crazy angles). But overall, a nice little shop. :)
Nb27Q8SYKbhqGNMhUY6IoA : Lunch was good, but Le Pain Quotidien won me over with chocolate.  I really wanted to try  the tuna salad tartine, but unfortunately the kitchen had run out for the day.  So instead I tried the chicken curry tartine, which was good, but not great.  The cobb salad was good, also.  But the stand-out was the bread, and the trio of spreads that were served with it, including a fantastic belgian praline.  We also bought a fresh challah to take home, along with an apple-pear turnover, a couque suisse and - the highlight of my week - the mini duo chocolate mousse.  It was so absolutely perfect and fantastic that I went back the next day and bought another.
BW3MKcFDQVuw7sJnSYM95w : No Thai is to thai food what BTB is to mexican food -- it's perfect for when you're craving thai-like food, but you don't have time to drive anywhere or sit in a restaurant. It's tasty food, but it reminds me of a quick-order place you'd find in a mall cafeteria. With that in mind, it's a bit pricey (about $9 per dish), but you usually can get 2 meals out of it if you're not totally famished.  The pad thai is a bit bland (mostly noodles with little else), but some of the other dishes (pad thai curry, gang pak, etc.) are pretty tasty. I usually go for ones that have a lot of veggies in them so that you get more food/nutrition for you $$.
nDHmW_rFg5a1l55wK_QB6w : I went to see Gaslamp Killer and Prefuse 73 here the other night and was not impressed by the middle east. The downstairs area really is a basement, the ceilings are low, their is poor air circulation, it is hot and cramped. On top of that the security staff is extremely rude and overly aggressive. The crowd was very peaceful and relaxed yet every time you come back intro this dungeon the bouncers insist on patting you down thoroughly. At one point i looked over and a bouncer was giving me a dirty look. These guys are tools anyways and they thing there tough. I'd be mad if i worked in a dark dungeon to. Also, they walk around through the crowd for no reason making people move out of the way. Sound was mediocre.
-HHKXGcbC3OQ0oXfFDkdHA : I remember my grandmother walking us down here for lunch on many occasions. The Rice and Beans are so good. Being Italian I really have no idea what I'm ordering or what it's called but the fried pork thingies and the potatoes with the meet inside were awesome. The portions are large and everyone is very nice. They seem to go on vacation for weeks at a time but when they are there its awesome.
w4P3HV9VBkd_LARq4VR3dw : Great location, right on Church St, but small, so plan to eat your ice cream outside.  Chocolate Orgy is delish, also love the tofutti alternatives.  My favorite way to eat Lizzy's: bring it into the theater and enjoy with a movie.  Cheaper than JP, but still great selection of unique flavors.
Wz9fl14BgaLZw0APTVjz2g : Convenient, but overpriced, and nothing really fresh like fruit. They do have toiletries, so I got a box of tissue at one point in time. Not sure how late they open.
La3JJb4Uvrf--oZ2o_llAA : 2010 Lineup: JUNE 9  Sherlock Holmes (PG-13) JUNE 16  The Hangover (R) JUNE 23  The Blind Side (PG-13) JULY 7  The Hurt Locker (R) JULY 14  Fantastic Mr. Fox (PG) JULY 21  Hot Tub Time Machine (R)
KxdMgQU-XAVu3dCaGmf6UQ : It's been a while since I visited the place, the food was pretty good, not far above the standard average Thai places.   Prepare for rude wait staff though. The last time I was here, the wait person yelled at me for taking a peek at her waiting list clip board. And when we left without leaving her a tip (not sure why she would expect one after yelling) , she chased us down the street and demanded an explanation. It was quite a scene, and obviously I won't be going back there anytime soon.
cTSUBo2QouAyVmIYvYtVOQ : I'm Chinese, but my stomach craves pizza. lol  I'm one of the biggest fans of their BBQ chicken pizza. I'm a creature of habit  (and boring) get this pizza 95% of the time.  I like their appetizers, like the lettuce wraps and Cabo crab cakes.  Most of the time, I don't have room for dessert.  p.s. again, you can get two free hours of parking if you know the right garage to park in.
-IzhO5BLmLyH6bupN9F0sA : Though I would not say it is the best in the city, it does stand out for selling novelty size pizza with out loosing out on the taste and hey the prices aren't to expensive.  Also they make a decent, Sicilian slice.
ZGiBY3v3jkYgXjitpCQBsw : Thanks to Tamarind, I think I've found my new favorite Indian dish: Saag. It's like an indian version of creamed spinach.  YUM!
SRYGB48zOJAw86pLYOxzRw : I'm from the Crimean city of Yalta (on the Black Sea) and had heard all about Stixs. So when I was on UT campus for a business meeting (isn't that where ALL business meetings are, on college campuses?), I HAD to try it out.  Frankly, I'm glad to see that many (though seemingly not all) of the obviously fake reviews for Stixs have been removed.  Not sure how that happened but kudos to Kevin or Stixs or whomever removed them.  I'm actually NOT a Russian businessman.  I'm a Realtor here in town and was showing some campus-area condos to a client so I thought I'd give Stixs a shot and write an ACTUAL (*gasp*) review.  The atmosphere was pretty cool... simple, clean, but interesting.  The prices seemed a little high... I paid almost $10 for water, two shish-k-bobs, some mashed potatoes, and the sauce of my choice.  The person who took my order (counter service) was friendly and helpful and recommended the Argentina Chimicurri sauce.  So I had one skewer of 3 shrimp, one skewer of 4 pieces of chicken (both included various veggies) and it was good.  Frankly the Chimicurri sauce was AWESOME.  Overall, I'd eat there again because the food was really good.. like almost 5 star good.  But I think it's a little overpriced... I feel like I should be able to get a meal and a drink for around $10 when I'm essentially on campus and don't have a waiter.  So points off for that and the fact that they were out of the salmon (my first order).  I'd say my first Stixs experience was worth 4 stars.  But even though many of the fake reviews have disappeared, I'm compelled to remove a star for the ones that remain.  I hope this place gets the pricing and marketing down and makes it because the food is quite good.
EzWpihNs9rz3rPMN8v3afA : When I eat out, I typically like to eat a meal that I probably couldn't make myself (minus a few fast food options).   I never got into Noodles, although I know some people love it. I've had a couple different of their dishes there, and all have left me somewhat unsatisfied but full. (Watch out for dry chicken!!!)
V8kpiQRiJc5-fTIH9QM3NQ : I don't understand the hype about Veggie Heaven.   Con 1. The place is extremely dirty. Covered from grease and old bits of food. Even the menus were grease. I had to use a napkin to hold them. Very, very unsanitary.  2. The food is inedible. The noodles were soggy and the flavoring is... just bad. The food is bland. And I love vegetarian dishes but not from here. 3. I understand that the owners support Fa Lung Gong but must you include brochures of it inside the restaurant and on the menu?   Pro 1. I know a lot of people come here because of the cheap prices, which is for obvious reasons.. But there's others that you can get vegetarian for the same price and tastes good.
scIAF8KLUKg5CyNwqmIy7w : This place is fantastic. Cookies, croissants, and Danishes are just fantastic and the prices are reasonable. Always nice to hit this place up when strolling through the Farmer's Market on a Sunday morning. Staff us always youthful and friendly which keeps the place cheery. A few times I've also had cakes from here and they're always awesome. If you haven't had them before I'd definitely recommend the mocha cookie or the dark chocolate peanut butter cookies.
OPzB1IFXewarRA7ZD4eCOg : I a huge fan of the "morning meal" (even if it occures sometime around noon) and am in a ongoing search to find the perfect breakfast place.  This certainly isn't it, but they're still a nice place to grab breakfast at if you're interested in venturing outside the apartment/house/condo.  They have the largest breakfast burrito I've ever seen (it's the same size as your regular Mexican burrito), and they're quite good.  Service is informal and pretty decent.  While the waitress didn't go out of her way to put on a giant fake smile for me, she was fast and helpful.  My understanding is that they only hire female CalPoly students -- the tip jar even said "Girls Night Out."
JcALF7KjhpgMc4U6n4wLzA : I love the freedom to customize my meal at Veggie Planet. All of the options seem great on paper but don't deliver as much as I hoped them to.  The restaurant is small and cramped and the staff are just ok.
IuvW33rzAkUbEgUvdYyFrw : eh... really refreshing & good, fresh unique/exotic food... but pretty expensive! almost everything you'll get comes in small portions... esp the "large" ceviche. the size portion was disappointing - the waiter even claimed it was enough for 2 people...  not really. my friend & i shared that with a blue crab causa....  if only the prices were more reasonable.... & they had better service? (the atmosphere was way too casual for me....)
TDVHAGBBzq-Gc9miS4O5Fw : This is where I'd eat when I was a poor undergrad and needed a quick, cheap bite. It was either this or a donut from kingpin...needless to say, I love blondie's. It's open late night too, which can be really convenient. Some people say fat slice is better - they are wrong, it is just greasier and limper. Blondie's serves up a nice, old fashioned slice and it is big, cheap and delicious. This isn't gourmet, this is BLONDIE'S!  And in addition, this place is definitely old school. My dad has been taking me here since I was a wee one, when he'd walk me around campus and tell me "look, this is where you're going to go!" (he was right). We'd buy our Blondie's pizza and eat on campus watching the college kids go by (it was weird seeing little kids doing the same with their parents when I was a student here). The crap they have hung up inside blondie's used to disturb me as a kid. And they still do.
gyrk4_IHgHfDG9TUSsQu_Q : The cotton candy and Chèvre (goat cheese) bacon & onion tart alone are reasons to come here. The tart was out of this world. Save some of your bread for this because it's even better on bread spread with some of the delish fig conserve it comes with.  I thought the food was very good. My boyfriend got the Striper and he enjoyed it. I'm not a seafood person, but I tried a bite. Didn't love the fish (per usual) but the seasoning was all there.  I got the Steak Au Poivre and it was pretty decent. I think the sauce was a little heavier than it needed to be, but it wasn't slathered all over the steak, so it didn't bother me. The seasoning on the steak alone was perfect and it was cooked a perfect medium. The pommes pure' (aka mashed potatoes) were very good also. Good and homemade with a tiny bit of chunk.  For my drink, I got the Naked French Maid, which was very yummy and gave me a nice little happy even though you could barely taste the alcohol.  The cotton candy is the best part. We took ours to go.  I'd definitely come back here. There are plenty of other items on the menu I'd love to try out. There's also a lot of space in here. We went on a Wednesday night, but only the main area had people in it. There's a whole other dining room complete with couches and pillows.
-sBpb21iCPuLc1Qi0TYpbw : Great selection of beer and wine. I don't know of a place that has larger beer and wine selection than this in the area (if there's some place that does, let me know). The price ranges are good for someone looking for a cheap bottle of wine (e.g. Lost Valley for under $5), to some that are in the $40-50 range. The beer tends to be more expensive, but they're not the cheap brews you want to get you drunk in a hurry.   Friendly and knowledgeable staff. Any time I'm looking for a wine for a specific meal in a certain price range, they been able to suggest selections that have yet to disappoint.   Friday beer tasting! Saturday wine tasting!! If you're around during Thanksgiving holiday, it's also a great treat. I couldn't ask for a better store.
fDw0dd2prwmC4I9qx_iQtw : Boring atmosphere, bad wait staff, bad bartenders that take FOREVER. Interesting music occasionally. I hate to criticize other fellow Yelpers, but people on this thread wrote a review for the Middle East Downstairs, which does have good shows, but it's a different place all together. If the drinks here were dirt cheap to fit with the atmosphere, it wouldn't be bad at all, I just feel like going here costs way more than the experience is worth. I'm also not a big fan of the way the owners do business. But what do I know, I'm just a drunk!
WgOG9rgrKWY9u9K72ZPxzA : Came here on a whim my last night in Houston. Lots of outdoor seating (front and back patio) and space to move around inside. The decor is mellow, low lighting inside and on the front patio set a relaxing mood. I did try the strawberry basil margarita and it really is great. The flavors are subtle, though I wouldn't drink 10 of them in one sitting. The bloody marys were something of interest, I didn't get a chance to try them though..  If you are a smoker, there is plenty of space for you to do so. Also, if the front bar is crowded try the one on the back patio, it was alway empty! If I come back to Houston I will need to stop by again!
uz908-kINBb0gawtIWqBnA : I *love* the Lone Wolf. Love it!   While it's a giant pain to go there on Sundays (the lines are always epic), it's worth the wait. Better to go on a weekday, however. The waiters are nice and the atmosphere is lovely. Wish it were bigger.  The prices are hefty if you're a barely-paid college student like myself, so it's a perfect once or twice a semester treat. I can imagine having a real job and a real paycheck would make the place quite affordable.   In reference to the previous review about Lone Wolf catering... it's not the best in the world, but it's still good. The student group training it caters is always very appreciative. I've never heard any groans or grumbles!
qQ7B0CtdpRh8C272r8HFAg : I don't think I've ever gotten a single coffee here, but I never failed to get a big round hunk of honey wheat bread.  That bread was so good it made the whole cafe smell yummy and cozy when they baked it.  In fact, it may be the only reason why I ever looked forward to group meetings.
ot3m6CHqPs3DBe0yg_QnLg : I love the food at Bacchus. The garlic bread is great and so are the pizzas. The only problem we had was that the waitress was not friendly and came off rude and aggressive. It was like she was working the bar in a western saloon. "What'll ya have"?  Very gruff and off putting. This is my second time here and the first time we had a different waitress who was good. Bacchus - check who was working on the eve of July 16 and give her some training in customer service.
xx2dfSoX4x-pSlxV7wB2Vg : First I bash Eats, and now this....  Are there any other "Atlanta Institutions" that I can go after?  I love grease, give me a funnel.  But even the grease doesn't make the grade here.    The dogs suck.  You can give me a Kroger brand frank boiled in Chattahoochee River water, and that would be a better fate.  Joey Chestnut would become a mere hot dog eating mortal trying to choke down one of these things.  In college, places like Eats and The Varsity are acceptable because you are broke and pretty much...drunk.  But then you become a little older...a little wiser...and realize that even though you are still drunk (and possibly still broke), there are better places to eat.
wwidSrdbugf_78Qm9Oqa5A : You craving a yummy, light breakfast? Then come here and get their breakfast sandwich.  The sandwich feels light and tastes delicious.  I mainly come here just for the breakfast sandwich.  I've had a regular sandwich once, but wasn't that excited about it.  But that was just one of their many sandwiches, so maybe I just chose the wrong one.    Don't be put off by the long line, it moves pretty quickly!  On nice days they have some outdoor seating too.
WwM6DJ-pmDdGk0uNpACrJA : Nice cafe, solid location (right by both Pitt and CMU campuses), consistent wi-fi (sometimes a bit slow), and a nice atmosphere for sitting around all day with that rich coffee smell all over your clothes.  The coffee isn't the best, but it's a great place to spend time. If you're looking for delicious coffee and a smiling staff, you'll be severely disappointed--welcome to Pittsburgh. But, regardless, I still love it at Kiva Han.  I usually go back about once every other week to enjoy a cheap eat (the macaroni and cheese is caked with cheese and paprika, the wagon wheels are delicious, the penne pasta is just as good). Everything comes out fresh and light, and they call your name with the order--also, the iced tea is by far my favorite unsweetened iced tea in Pittsburgh.  It might sound weird, but check out the bathrooms. They're filled with art and writing all over the walls that you'd expect to find in coffee shop bathrooms (but don't happen at the large chains that plague the rest of the Oakland area).  Come with a friend or two, read a book, poke fun at some of the artwork, people watch all day.
ufRKu3CYqfgkiGfEJvEaFw : I had a wonderful experience at Enzo's pizza!  First of all the place was clean and packed, which was a good sign, and crowded with wide spectrum of people.  There was of course several UCLA students, there was business men and women, there was the wannabe supermodels, and my favorite was who I presume was Enzo and his buddy, but I'll save that for later.  On, to the pizza  Enzo's is a good sized, thin but heavy, greasy slab o pie.  It doesnt have a very crunchy crust and bottom, but, where Enzo's succeeds where many other pizzeria's fail is the flavor.  They use good cheese, and good well balanced sauce in perfect moderation.  The sauce is not too heavy on the tomato flavor or the oregano flavor and is just sweet enough.  But what really made me give this place a 5 star yelp was sitting outside next to whom I presume was Enzo (because he had a pizza stained rag thrown over his shoulder) and his equally Italian buddy who's name I didnt catch.    Now imagine this great dialog with 2 extremely heavy Italian accents:  Enzo: I need a new caar, ya know, I mean the denali's nice and all but I mean Im fuckin payin through the asshole on gas! you gotta guy who does financin down there? Buddy: Ya we gotta guy, hes good too. Whatcha wanna get, you should see this BMW we got in the other day, real nice, big, classy, my brother came on to the lot the other day and got a hard on just lookin at it Enzo: Ya BMW's is a nice car, right? Ya real nice, whats it do for gas Buddy: Pretty good, you know what a lot of people are drivin these days is those Audi's Enzo: You fuckin with me? Audi's huh?   And so on....  It was delightful. Made me feel like I was New York, except it was sunny, cleaner, cheaper and not so crowded.  Multo Bene!
6pdz-dn05T9elIBSEQ79qg : This review is for the Happy Hour only.  The reviews had me worried, but as far as I can tell, Boom Noodle isn't that bad.  A friend and I tried it out last week for a yay-it's-Friday happy hour.  The beers on tap were fairly limited, but we both found one we liked.  Their specialty drinks looked more interesting and were at a lower price during happy hour, but I just wasn't up for anything harder than beer at the time.  As far as food goes, the ebi katsu (shrimp) were absolutely delicious, and they came with a great sauce.  We also tried the spring rolls, and they tasted good-- can you really mess up spring rolls?-- except they were super-big-around and kind of hard to eat.    The ambiance was more trendy and almost sports-bar like in the bar area than authentic Asian.  You'd expect that in U-Village, though.  Service wasn't exactly friendly, but not rude in any way and definitely efficient.  Based on our experience and the price of the regular menu, I'm not sure if I'll be back for dinner, but I'll definitely try it again for a happy hour spot.
HtV3IxOu-LtziAtH2XLUyw : How many times have I, while walking back from the gym totally starving, completely undone all my hard work by springing for a jumbo slice?  More than I care to say.  I'm not even vouching for the taste - it's just really big and really quick.
I-VlgSZygkfKZFf3GhKC-g : I'm not sure why people still go to Hollywood video across the street??  You can get new movies here for about $3 compared to almost $6 at Hollywood.  And sometimes you can even get a movie a week before it comes out!  How great is that? I use to work at Studio Video, it was probably one of the best jobs i've had while i was in college.  I got to watch movies all day and get paid for it!  Haha.  Plus Kenny (the owner is a pretty dope guy) And one more thing!  Studio video has an ADULT VIDEO section!  If you're not sold yet then now you should be lol. Come help a small business out!  Plus i think hollywood is going out of business anyways, serves them right!
lzBe7pVPKhN2TvepHutG9A : This place is fuckin bomb...fresh grilled chicken n beef an white rice... I could live of this... An that sauce? I wish they sold it by the gallon... Both of em..
VSzd3TDBug683elOSxe7xQ : Unfortunately I have to knock off a star because I haven't always experienced this stellar level of customer service that everybody else describes.   I went in to buy a cleanser and the guy could not have been less interested in answering my questions about the products. I was lucky to get a few grunts out of him. Thankfully there was a customer in there who had used the Stinger brand cleanser and said it worked for her (it ended up working for me too!). I don't really expect employees to know every single thing about each item but I do appreciate to be spoken to in full sentences (or hell, even just words would be great).   Aside from that one unfortunate interaction, everything else has been great. I miss the Glassy Knoll but BC has nice pieces so it eases the sting a bit. It's also fun to look at all of the ridiculously expensive, intricate "water pipes."
b2R1ye5zxkehNfgrPp-ZrQ : COOKIES RULE EVERYTHING AROUND ME (CREAM!) and that is exactly what i did--i creamed my pants because this was so good. i ordered a turtle/peanut butter cookie combo with butter pecan ice cream. the first bite was so heavenly and savory, i nearly went weak in the knees. warm and gooey with the nutty pecans in the turtle cookie and the peanut buttery goodness in the other cookie, combined with the sweet, savory butter pecan ice cream.... i just creamed myself again.  and i think it was just $1.50? i can't remember... but it's very affordable.
e9-21ANUot2D6K0731MqzA : Hmm went here for the 1st time last night and had loads of fun and the place was quite...interesting. One room to the left of the entrance(guitar room) was playing hip hop while the one straight ahead was techno and had some dancers. At first, we were like...uh wtf is this and after a few drinks, we just went with the flow. lol.   The music in the guitar room was SHITTY. Uh thong song, Janet Jackson, Im on a boat.....seriously? And then they had a bikini contest which was kinda odd. There was also some filming taking place. It was just a whole load of mess.  My friends and I got on the bar and danced and got some shots for doing that. Overall, I would rate it 3 stars just for that freaking music and the randomness going on.   It was a good mixed crowd and the bathrooms were clean. I will not go back again because I dont like to pay for parking. o_0 (I paid 10).
FdqhzMPOMuYrYb-YKtJlaw : Zingerman's is the one place I remember from my last trip to Ann Arbor, and it's not just for the food (though they really do seem to have everything) - it's for the whole vibe of the place, the cute signs and friendly staff and home-like feel.  A place with that same level of critical acclaim here in the Bay Area would have a staff that looks at you with icy disdain as if to say, "We know we're written up in all the food blogs and magazines, and you should thank us for serving you." Zingerman's whole aura, by comparison, says "Come on in! We're happy to have you! Try this, you'll love it!" It's very refreshing for those of us visiting A2 from certain places.  Not sure if that makes the sandwiches worth $15 a pop, but still, very refreshing.
1FERXDtEcxVWZSWv3Y_ueQ : What a fun, fun joint!  I wouldn't give it 5 stars only because it can definitely be improved and thus it's not yet "as good as it gets" but hey, I'm a total fan.  What improvements, you ask?  I just wish there was more accommodation in terms of people helping you through the many, many different and interesting instruments they have.  Or, maybe, even small write-ups next to instruments to let you know what you're looking at.  As it is, everyone is pretty much left to explore on their own and to just have fun.  So yeah, a little extra information and attention would be nice.  Still, super fun little place in the Claremont Commune (shout-out to my hippies!)
iqS_0TnxC3Df5SMTb2mGjA : I just have to rave about this place.  Try the farm waffle with blueberries add whipped cream - and definitely add the maple syrup.  It's far from the best dish for your body, but it is delicious!  The whole area is gorgeous and rural, the staff is very friendly and professional and there are a ton of things to purchase in the restaurant itself.  I highly recommend it.  For wheelchairs, it's fairly accessible.  It can be a tad difficult to get in the door, as there is a bump in the doorway, but I am sure the staff will help anyone who needs it, and it's definitely worth the minimal amount of effort.  I went there on a cold, overcast March morning, and didn't go close to the animal pen and the rest of it, but I intend to return some time when it is warmer and sunnier out.  I did see some goats playing nearby in the pen, however.
_Rm3ijWWGcuTGpjnJfAQzQ : I never had Turkish  before Pasha so I cant say, "meh. Ive experienced better." But, I will say its a 2/5 stars in my book.  Nothing was more than decent except their hot chai thai served traditional stye--small lil cup.  Went back in Nov '10, cant really remember what we ordered but I know we had an appetizer and an entree each.  The place got filled up by several tables of chinese looking Khazakistans though  Interestingggg. I know only bc I asked the waitress what language were they speaking to their other tables. had exceptional service, no doubt. I think I spent $65 for me and the bf for dinner.  I wanted to like it but it just wasnt for me. Maybe another Turkish restaurant will change my mind.
Wf6A47Of_JZPQeTQDjoJhA : Look, in a City full of cheesteaks for the most part pretty terrible ones, Abners doesn't really rise head and shoulders above the competition. Now just because I can't deal with cheesteaks much anymore, doesn't mean I'm pilling on the hate for Abners. Infact it's an sentimental fave of mine. It was one of my very first taste of Philadelphia. Late at night, drunk, above the defunct club wizards. It is what it was and still remains, just another steak shop. But it was the first, no you never forget your first.
eo46UuxvV9jcfy_jTJcLsA : I usually go here for Happy Hour.  At least once a month since I started at UCSD.  We came here with a coupon...$10 off your bill of $35 or more.  So we did just that.  One 2 for $20 deals and I got a bunch of appetizers and an Electric Lemonade aka AMF to hit $35 before tax.  I give the server the coupon and he says the manager says it's not valid because it can't be combined with any other promotions.  What promotion?!  I did not know 2 for $20 was a promotion!  It's on their menu ever since day 1!  Don't give me that!  I look at the bill again and they didn't take 50% off any of the appetizers!  Whoa!  Get this thing out of my face!  The server then talked to the manager and said it's not Happy Hour prices.  Homie!  Get the manager with a damn menu!  The manager comes looking grumpy like he doesn't enjoy his job.  I put on a good customer face and tone and he was going to argue that it's not Happy Hour prices.  Open that menu you should know front and back.  And he said, "Oh, I forgot it was Happy Hour hours..."  So he grumpily changes our receipt correctly and just gives it to me without an apology!  Just walks off like he doesn't enjoy his job.  First of all, if you're going to be a manager, know your policies.  Second, if you're going to agree to do coupons, can you acknowledge them?!  Third, if you hate your job, then don't talk to complaining customers.  You are the face of that franchise and you act snobbish.  Get out.  This was the default place for a place to eat near UCSD.  I'll take my money elsewhere for better service.  It took forever to get our food, it was a bit cold, I try to resolve an issue and ask for the manager, but he comes out lagging and grumpy 10 minutes later.  At least pretend you enjoy your job.  Or give us a discount for making us stay an extra 324523434 minutes.  End of my rant.  Clowns.
LMYR7mTTbOm3VliQSjajjg : Most comprehensive academic bookstore in Harvard Square. A great selection of remainder books, especially large coffee table art books. Also contains a decent used book section, though nothing like Strand in NYC.
qwYpgZCa25vaYvMVP8A4pw : This store was literally a few blocks away from my place, and definitely more spacious due to the arrangements of the items for sale.  It seemed as if Yarntopia has a modest collection of yarns and literature on knitting.  The store owner was pleasant, and discussed if you signed up for the emailing list, notifications of upcoming classes will soon be sent out for the summer.  The sale section is basically buying in bulk of 1 solid color for cheapest at $50 - $100 (depending how many yarns are inside the bag).
OdHyb1AQDyVnfjXf0_p0JA : We've never eaten in, but ordered takeout a couple of times.  It's been decent -- standard northern-style Indian fare.  Palak paneer, baingan bharta, chicken tikka, vindaloos, naans, basmati rice.  All done well and tasty.  The cook seems accommodating to a variety of spice preferences, and it's good to have some vegetarian options in this town.  But here's one weird thing: every dish came garnished with lots of slivered ginger.  Not too big of a deal, as it was easily removed, but odd, nonetheless.  What gives?
sFOzKukMosU-oyn4zIZ7Ug : Another burger/asian food place. What's the difference between this and the other restaurants on the ave?   One. The burgers here are actually pretty good. They have a lot of variety and the meat was  cooked well everytime i ordered a burger. My favorite, is the hand-cut fresh fries that they give with their burgers. It doesn't make me feel like I'm gonna get a heart attack after I eat it. So that's a plus :D.  Two. They have wraps! The ave is filled with unhealthy foods, which we all love. But, it's nice to taste some fresh food once  in a while. That's what subway is there for. Now, there is Rock 'n Roll Grill with wraps. I only tried one wrap and it was pretty good. They also come with the hand-cut fries and it comes at a relatively cheap price.  I recommend coming here maybe at least once if you have never come. If you don't want to try another burger or asian food place, try one of their wraps.   I just don't like how loud they play their music.
z8yr5t1H8h4-eLK18H30aA : I admit, I grew up with the blue and gold across the bay (Cal Bears) but moving to the Silicon Valley, I have come to admire the red and gold and the tree.    I have visited the campus for business and to check out their free lectures on space, religion and art http://events.stanford.edu/byCategory/2/, Roblos dance studio http://www.yelp.com/biz/stanford-ballroom-dance-club-stanford#hrid:g07VIHfzP7J4jcdm0degiA/src:search/query:dance, Canton art museum http://www.yelp.com/biz/cantor-arts-center-palo-alto#hrid:S3UrELw-BgqE52egVHjHtg/src:self, art galleries http://www.yelp.com/biz/thomas-welton-stanford-art-gallery-stanford#hrid:MFGCpxJeD2PT8dePg9R6YA/src:self  , sculpture gardens and art tours.  After 4pm and on the weekends, the parking is free.  The surrounding areas are a madhouse with traffic and parking when there are games and public events at Stanford.  They are always building, must be nice to have money and rich and generous alumnis.  Love the vibe on this campus.
ZRAwxSSunp5Vb84MbTKh4Q : Flavorful, strong, and inexpensive coffee. The panini and pre-made sandwiches are quite good, too (I can vouch for the black forest ham and cheese baguette and the salmon panini). At $5, the half-panini and soup combo is a delicious bargain. Service is generally speedy, but they can take a while to prepare the hot food.
P5NT8WdbxgfMAioWhQUOgg : There is a reason these folks have shopping baskets.  The Record Exchange is not so much a consumer stop as it is plans for the afternoon.  Wonderful plans for the afternoon.  The vinyl selection is great, as is the budget used section.  Frankly I'm not terribly familiar with their new cd section because I know I can buy more of my fantastic finds with my budget (yeah that's right I set a budget for myself when I go otherwise I will come home broke) if I stick to the used.  So go, shop, groove.   Seriously, why are you still here reading? Go support a kick@ss indie record store.
pPPh6DjLG97YPoOdEJPsCQ : Yay Yogurtland! Me & a couple coworkers started coming here everyother friday WHAT A TREAT I wish I could open my own..:) So many flavors & toppings ...decisions decisions  hehe I even got a free tshirt
FAAk90wEFaHZcLor7W50gQ : i cannot for the life of me remember what I had here.  but i do remember wanting some parsley to liven up my flavorless dish.   and really wanting to go home and yelp about it.   I think my dad had roasted chicken with a mushroom sauce and a croissant-like roll over mashed potatoes that was pretty good.  i thought it was really terrible for the price, but i did read somewhere later that they have a decent prix fixe deal that includes a movie ticket to fall creek next door!
UAIGwnZ2Yn2Gq--aa3rC0Q : Had to trek up to University City for a class I'm taking at Penn and needed a quick snack to make my day a bit better.  Crazy enough, I figured some froyo on a cold day would hit the spot.  I went into Sprinkles and was delighted to see something out of either NYC or LA, PLUS the self-serve option - they had about 10+ different flavors   I'm not a fan of someone else doing it and I also like to mix my options a bit so this place was definitely of potential.  However, once I got to the machine, the yogurt took FOREVER to get out - how old are these machines?  Also - my yogurt was runny and a bit full of sugar (maybe I just like the more subtle taste of greek-style).  Anyways, the toppings were decent although the fruit didn't seem too fresh.  Overall, I wasn't too thrilled with the outcome, especially since I paid a walloping $5.27 for something that wasn't that great.  Guess I'll just stick with Capogiro when I'm up in that area.
lnJZvFbazc294XEbZRhJDw : I love small portion dishes.  I been coming here for the last 7yrs and try almost everything on the menu.  I think the lamp chop is the best.  This place can get expensive so watch out.  Me and my friends will come in here order about 8-12 different dishes and drinks, and chill for about 2 hrs.  The service is a either excellent or bad so that is y they get 4 stars.  Come on the weedend and there is a band, pretty good band.
97yN9AspcNPoJBsz9rBYzA : A little pricey for what you get, but solid nonetheless.
yKA6GkACKtmDnhe8xD92ag : Great place!  Went there for a few drinks after dinner and had a really nice time. The atmosphere was similar to Whiskey in Durham, but without the annoying smoke.  They had an excellent piano player on that night, hope he is a regular player because I would love to hear him again.
IN2KeaneEehp9k9YDqeejA : Ralph's Fresh Fare... or Ralph's Lite, as I'm going to refer to it here.    So yeah, Ralph's Lite... hmmm let's see.  I'm assuming Ralph's opens these sorts of teenie tiny fancy stores in areas where there isn't enough real estate for a gigantic version...Ralph's Greatland if you will.    So yeah, Ralph's Jr in Westwood... let's just say a Ralph's size seems to be inversely proportionate to its prices...but this is Westwood.  Ok, Ok I'll stop bitching.  So Westwood is expensive whoop-dee-doo.  I'm over it.   So I walk on down the hill to pick up some bread and lunch meat to make some tasty sandwiches at work this week.  Overall the store is very clean, neat and organized.  You certainly feel that you're getting some atmosphere for your money.  I found my bread easily and continued on to the Deli counter.    The deli boasts a wide array of Boar's Head brand meats... pretty much known as the creme of the crop of cold cuts.  My eyes wandered the case and fixated on the delicious Mortadella with pistachios.  Paired with thinly sliced sharp provolone, just the thought of that duo made my mouth salivate...and then I took a number.    Number 93 to be exact.  The "now serving" meter said 91 so I was psyched.  I counted 8 people busily working behind the counter...and I figured given the prices you pay at this location this transaction should be a snap...  20 minutes later the serve-O-meter said 92.  I'm not kidding you.    I have no idea what the 8 individuals behind the counter were doing.  I watched as one greeted a customer...number 92...took the order and went on to clean all the meat slicers...painstakingly....before even pulling the meat out of the refrigerator.  She then got caught up in a stop and chat with a fellow deli worker.  This added another half a minute to the wait time.  Finally she unwraps the meat and decides it's time to change her gloves.  She re-wraps the meat neatly first....then changes gloves....then unwraps for a second time.  Mind you these actions are all completed at a snail's pace.    Finally the meat makes contact with the slicer.  She struggles to make the first slice.  She picks it up takes literally 30 seconds to turn around and show the customer the thickness.  I won't bore you with more details, but to serve each customer an average of two sliced items took around 10 minutes.    For clarity let me put it another way.  At a glance everyone looks super busy...but in actuality they are all doing a lot of "dilly dallying," as my father used to say.    I seriously wanted to jump the counter and kick some serious deli ass.
nsUNgr4eJhcS7S3sHvroWA : Yes, you might wait about 20 to 30 minutes for a pizza, but it's worth it.  The chicken cordon bleu was fantastic, and they don't skimp out on the toppings like a lot of pizza places I am used to.  Plus, you can share a medium pizza (which is quite large) for about $3-4 a person.  Our waitress was very friendly and quick about the service.  Best pizza I've had in a long while!
lWnL5EBv5ZwOySzV9t1_DA : I've seen this place around for a while now but never thought to try it. But, while going out around Westwood with a friend the other day, we thought we would try their desserts. I got the Chocolate Cheesecake, which, while HUUGGEE, tasted funny upon the first bite, but I guess I got accustomed to it since it was just a bombardment of sweetness and fatness anyway, as a cheesecake should be, I guess. But I did notice it was dense. I also noticed that they kind of keep their desserts encased in their deli fridge so the turnover depends on how many patrons opt for something sweet after dinner. Anyway, I did feel a bit funny after eating the cheesecake, but just thought it was because the cheesecake was particularly thick and dense (and indeed it was.. I could have been eating lard). But whatever, I thought it was good enough to take home, so I packed it and tossed it in the fridge. Sure enough, it was only a couple minutes later that I actually started feeling legitly queasy and my stomach started bloating up!  Then comes tonight: I went out to another restaurant in Westwood and we thought that we could grab some dessert. So, naturally, not learning my lesson the first time, I suggest getting cheesecake at Jerry's. We sit down and this time I order the Strawberry cheesecake for the two of us. And yes, now we both have bloating stomachs and some major indigestion. Hardly a great way to end the night.  So.... The moral of the story is that if you are too lazy to go out to Cheesecake Factory and are in the mood for a night of tummyaches, this is the place to go for desserts :)
ZKrrDT21sKg_T4qQWRHVgQ : Disregard my previous review. They have changed ownership since and I haven't had a chance to go back.  3-stars for not knowing... sorry if it skews the rating.
9Iyq2wOz--hz4U6TgVc17w : This review simply reflects the awesome time I had at Make It New, the techno/electronic dance party that tubthumps it up 9pm-2am on Thursdays.    There must be some sort of delicate alchemy at work to bring all the elements of great nightlife into alignment.  The crowd is fun, hip, and lovely.  The drinks are moderately priced and not without flair.  I really liked the Demi Peche, which was, from what I could make out from the bartender (who was trying to yell over the sampling of what sounded like Danish children yodeling backwards), wheat beer and peach extract.  And the music was lovely!  All in all, the good vibes reverb out from the speakers and seep into your bloodstream.  Oh, and no cover!  (On this night, at least)
_leIYDeYs8tkCJrqqcyhpA : This is one of my all-time favorite restaurants --   The chefs, people who run the restaurant, as well as the staff are all *very* nice -- as soon as you come in, they really make you feel welcome and relaxed.  In addition, the food is extremely fresh, and healthy.  They really care about how folks enjoy the food, and actively seek feedback from their customers (positive or constructive) to keep everyone happily fed.  I believe they're open from 11am till 9pm at night, Mon thru Sat:   http://www.chamkoreanbistro.com/cham2010/contact.htm  The SSAM garden platter w/ chicken is my all-time favorite.  runners up are:  steamed bun w/ spicy yuzu pork bulgogi + cilantro, candied sweet potatos (temporary special dish).  They also offer specials from time to time, and every one I've tasted has been delicious.  ++nom
onws1zn7UGBXN8ZQ1AWiBw : Nice, small theater. Shows great independent and foreign films that you never get to see at the mainstream theaters. Decently priced and never too busy, even on the weekends.
nOsF_g_ZonBThWiPQoHImw : Great pizza! Blows blondies out of the water(and I like Blondies too) The price is right and the za' is str8 grubbin. The stoners probably love this place, but I dont have to be high to crave some fat slice......get it everytime i'm in Berk
zHC1YMuU1VbSlgt4T-NzRw : Yesterday was a pretty bad day, won't get into the specifics because we are talking food here but it was a real bad one.  Anyway, whenever I encounter a day like yesterday if I can I head on down to the Bear Ramen House and get some Curry GukSu Soup.  There isn't anything that can make me feel like I am being "held" like that soup...well I guess next to actually being held.    This place is a hole in the wall, you can sit at the often crowded dingy counter and eat if you like or opt for the courtyard shared by neighboring restaurants...I usually schlep my soup home.  The broth is seasoned to perfection with just enough spice to pack a punch but not overpower the experience, the noodles are handmade and delicious.  The servings are huge and reasonably priced.  If you have a day that kicks you when your down, guaranteed, the Bear Ramen House will give you a nice warm hug.
F7Slwn4zKOiwaFU2Ll77xg : Not only bad customer service, but also no cohesive sense of style.  There is really nothing to set Monica's apart from the department stores to make shopping here worthwhile.  They have an eclectic mix of products, but they don't really mesh together.  The clothing pieces don't seem hand-picked to fit the boutique's sense of style; it's more just like - let's throw a bunch of brand names together and call it a boutique.  Most of the brands they carry here can be easily found in any department store (where there is also usually better sales and special deals).  Also, the salesgirls sorely lack any customer service skills that would draw in a local client base.  I'm surprised they make any sales, actually.  Overall, I'm not a fan.
hrGqgkmZh1oSrcEcBGz_Ow : tiny tiny tiny tiny hidden secret pizza shop! go see at movie at the Harvard Film Archive and eat here afterwards.
8TFS8jN20ldpY_5_JVTcQw : Utterly disappointing, especially from all the reviews and always seeing crowds at all hours of the day.  The only thing relatively good about this place was there Chimichurri dip, the bread that came with it wasn't even that good, almost stale.  Service was very lacking; our waiter was a total wierdo and kinda creepy. He called us "young ones", when he himself was also "young". Whatever, it was really bizarre.  We shared their huge appetizer plate that is described beautifully, but not appetizing.  It had a slice of fresh mozzarella wrapped with prosciutto; mozz was ok, attempted to be fresh, but not quite.  The meat was just flavorless and dry. There was also polenta with thick pieces of portobello mushrooms; this is where I had my biggest issue, the mushroom had been sauteed in a pan that had just been used to saute eggplant because I couldn't even tell it was mushroom until my bf tried it twice.  I'm pretty sure that's a no-no.  It felt rubbery and just not good.  There was a ramekin of olives that I did not try, and a small dish of what seemed to be bbq'ed eggplant.  No There was a little salad that had flavorless ice cold pieces of calamari, but because there was no flavor, we thought it was chicken at first.  They had two pieces of extra hard bruschetta bread with goat cheese that was the best out of everything.    It took forever for our main course to arrive; I ate an entire basket of bread and dip to compensate for the disappointing appetizers.  I heard good things about their rib eye steak.  The sauteed spinach and potatoes were decent, but it would be hard to screw those up.  At first glance, the rib eye looked huge, but when we were done, more than half of it was just fat; I understand that it is a fattier cut of meat, but half? That's a lot, right? The meat was marinated well and could be cut with a butter knife, but there was hardly any meat, like I said.    We even skipped dessert because we were just soooo blah about everything else, I did not want to be disappointed again.  We live close by, and I've wanted to try it for awhile, and now that I got this outta my system, whenever we want steak, we'll stick with Beckham Grill, thanks.
Gv9obx_lQI0ZMIhl0F7UtA : This place never disappoints.  This place is right down the street from me, and whether I'm running home from work and need a quick place to eat, or if my boyfriend and I want a delicious cheap burger, this place always does it. Also, since its located on Berklee's campus, on Monday nights, you can enjoy your burger with a healthy dose of jazz upstairs - how cool is that?  My personal favorites? The Adopted Luke and the West Side.
uh2H4b-L0MMDuWPx6-7qtw : Dude... people are hating on this place. I LOVED IT IN COLLEGE. They have this spicy, southwestern pasta with really good chicken. It's amazing. They used to have crab cakes that RULED. I LOVED GOING OUT HERE. It's like Chapel Hill's version of going out in Santa Monica. Good looking people, put together crowd, 21- 31 year old crowd. On your 21st birthday (which i celebrated partially here... but those are some CRAZY stories), they will make you a mint chocolate chip martini (THAT IS TO DIE FOR) with 21 written in it in chocolate. They also have this amazing shot my friend found out about called a pineapple outside down shot. SO YUMMY SO YUMMY. I love this place. And you can't beat the location. It's named Top of the Hill for a reason.
ySDbS0qU5vhFHpoZW6AVzg : Free apple samples. It is pretty awesome when my friend and I intentionally finish our run at the orchard. We eat many apple samples to rehydrate. The apples are top notch, and they usually offer discounts on select varieties every day. They also have a neat selection of mustards, apple butters, and cider. I don't drink cider but my boyfriend is a fan, and I can use them for baking too.
T2qxu9xstB-UQPrk22g2Fw : Rating is for the burritos.  I ordered a chicken burrito.  It was, as promised, HUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGE - among Sam's, Chipotle, Gordo's (super burrito), and La Burrita (super burrito), Sam's is the biggest. This is actually probably the best-deal burrito you can get - also, buy 9, get 1 free.  Sam's is heartier than Chipotle (no lettuce, boo), lighter than La Burrita (not as... saucey).  It has a nice mild kick to it as well.  The proportions and well-mixed-ness of the ingredients are very variable and depend on who makes the burrito.  The tortilla has grill marks on it, which is awesome.  And they grill your meat on the spot.
-FxDb941jaSSYiTewf2KOg : Like usual, the places on-campus are either meh on taste and nice to the wallet or yummy and mean to the wallet...lemonade definitely is the latter.  Came her for lunch w/ the boyfriend not too too long ago and enjoyed the food we purchased. It was definitely overpriced for what we got (especially the protein) but it was delicious.   Today our professor brought us an assortment of baked goods from there. Everything was pretty good. The cupcakes were pretty standard (not the best, but definitely some of the better ones I've had) and the rice crispies treats covered in peanut butter and chocolate were delicious.   This place does get SUPER crowded around lunchtime, so beware! If you've never been here before, it can be quite confusing at first so it's definitely a plus to come when it's not busy.  Oh, and the lemonade (durr). My favorite is definitely the peach ginger. Expensive at $3, but dizzam, that flavor is AHHH-mazing!
HSZyANaM7KSyV7W_d1aoIg : Quite possibly the best theater in the city.  Gets all the great independent films and the staff are truly top notch - if you can imagine that at a movie theater!  Really knowledgeable about the movies and not afraid to tell you what's good or bad.  Too bad I didn't ask about Sideways BEFORE we went in.  Wow that isht sucked.  They felt bad for me and gave me a free popcorn refill for my VERY pregnant friend.  (Don't tell!)
b_6sv6K4PjO14gUgsgkWew : They always leave a bad taste in my mouth, at this location. They are too quick to serve you an extra side or a drink. It's more like a car sales lot than a food joint.  If I only buy a bowl of rice, thats my business. The comment below about profit margins proves I'm not the only one they tried to bully into buying more.  Plus, they are all too stingy with their food at this location.  Finally, one day, the first person didn't even listen to my panda bowl order and started serving me in a  two-side dish, I didn't get upset, but he did when I told him I just wanted a panda bowl. pffft. Almost always, it is not a pleasurable experience.
HQoaOpaX1hV1ybqStsOopQ : Yum yum yum!!!   Boar's head sausilito turkey sammich with smoked sharp cheddar on sqaw, side of potato salad, marinated mushrooms and pepperocini . All for 8.29. They charge $1 for cheese. But comes with any 1 sides in display case (must have silver spoon) and marinated mushrooms. No toaster :( otherwise i wouldve gotten sourdough.  yay for sampling!
utBN33I5uosnVta-D7ghEQ : i love them! they put me on tv.   their casadilla is sooooooooooooooo good.   their outside 7grand a lot! and the people who work here are THE BEST!
kJZVeLyw_PmuKI2gBe1Vew : A great place to hanve drinks, watch the games, eat the single handed best tri tip sandwiches ever, get the onion rings, get a side of beans, get some ribs- then then come back tomorrow because you will want more.  The days of Poly were best when we ate here.
T940faSTbZk0bmYpea-VtA : The interior decor is amazing. The wait staff are very friendly and courteous. A must mention is the sangria. A pitcher cost about 23 dollars but you can get a good 9-10 glasses out of it. If you are looking for a good drink and a good buzz...this is the way to go. Unless you want to pay 10 dollars for a glass. Save money and get the pitcher.
Tgh2gwF8DYkXdh7chAkxCQ : We popped in for a snack and a drink, left stuffed! Great place to refuel during a shopping trip in Harvard Sq.
Z0n01pQcf-tQf01Iqd0CPw : Is Kip's dirty? Undeniably.   Uncomfortable? Absolutely.   Broken down? Like a mid-life crisis.   And what's not to love? Hard to say. The spilled beer, the smell of vomit, and the rancid odors fuming from the bathrooms all accumulate to create exactly what many Berkeley students have come to love.   In fact, the reason the place continues to be smelly, broken down and uncomfortable is because of its popularity (and a bit of upkeep issues). Kip's, just like the beer it serves, is an acquired taste. Once acquired, that's when you realize you're in college. Is college perfectly comfortable and happy? No. It's an experience. And Kip's encompasses just that.  I'd try it out, or to continue the played-out analogy, experiment. The beer is cheap if you buy pitchers, the music is decent and the people are a blended mixture of meat heads with something to prove and people there to have a good time. Find the right crowd, dance, grab a pitcher, maybe play a game of pool and it can make for a pleasant night.
t61-q9CKX_pEvJok-QuWcA : I've been here twice and I will say that I've never had a better sandwich in my life! I've eaten many a sandwich in my lifetime and I do believe (although I obviously can't remember EVERY sandwich I've ever eaten) that this takes the cake. Aptly named sandwich, this place is behind Panang off Franklin, and can be a little hard to find, but they are moving to a fresh hip spot right on the infamous street itself. I look foreward to the future of my life now that sandwich is a part of it!   P.S. about a dollar overpriced, but the quality more than makes up for it in my book
GVAlHUIDXUZX18GvwtlYsA : Maybe because it's close to home, or such a small place, or because there was no one else there when we entered at noon on Sunday, but for some reason I wasn't expecting too much. So i was totally shocked to have possibly the best reuben I've ever eaten. All the elements were just right - nice light rye bread, lean corned beef that still had plenty of flavor, swiss and cheddar cheese, wonderfully fresh-tasting sauerkraut, and Russian dressing that instead of that thick gloppy orange stuff was thin, red in color, with just the right flavor. I'd give it a nod over Kenny & Ziggy's if you just want a sandwich, and I love that place.
DYkr5_WyFp2vF0xHfWWmjA : I LOVED this place. I hate fast food, not because I'm a snob who objects to it, I just don't like it and it doesn't occur to me to eat it. I also hate eating on business trips, the whole eating by myself thing sucks, and I can't figure out what I want. But I walked past this place and was blown away at how simple the menu was and how it had all the things I wanted for dinner. I was so pleased and my food was fresh, good quality, and hot.
lVzwIo2rFIFwgtVT9BUDhw : I have been going to CA or over 20 years now and each time has been successful. I've asked as many questions as anyone can and they always have an answer or at least where I can get the answer. Recently, when my trucks window reg and motor failed, I called to see if they had the part in stock. Not only was it the right price but they were willing to put it aside for me or a POSSIBLE next day pick up. Whether you need a wiper blade, tail light bulb or whatever, it's where I shop....now and always.
YmK7By8Z-xzRQ6tgnVyHug : In general, I like the Publix chain. However, in every Publix I have ever entered there is a weird smell just inside the entrance.  What's up with that?
gxtIqz74F__KH1toDVyc-Q : I luv it. We just moved into a new place and I ordered blinds, ceiling fans and bookshelves. They have great customer service that can very helpful, when there are not too busy that is. Plus, they can set up any installations. The prices can be good if you find the right deals or catch something on sale. My only complaint is calling and trying to figure out where my orders were. I got useless customer service reps and bounced around to a few different phone numbers until I gave up.
UUI_vetSGRzehHb6MZ7w5A : Stepping into famous lunch is like stepping back in time. the lunch counter over looks the grill where your food is prepared, or you can sit in a vintage booth across the aisle. It really is an awesome dining experience. I had two with everything and an RC cola. Everything is their chili/meat sauce, mustard, and chopped onions. they are tasty, and the hot dogs themselves are also among the best i've had. i wish i had tried famous earlier, but unfortunately in a couple of months i won't be hanging out in troy nearly as much.
lfDEmgHWlUKZ1Sb2DmU3gQ : This is genuine pizza. No tomato paste. Delicious and hot. Ready when they say it will be ready.
rymhsIJ1dCT-FZItmDdZag : This location is within walking distance from my home and I am so glad because their parking lot (which they share with Peets and Einstein's Bagels) is a complete nightmare most hours of the day.  The shelves are usually well stocked. They have a nice selection of fresh produce at good prices. They don't have a great variety of brands but they do have British specialty items like Spotted Dick (hee hee hee, she said Dick) HP sauce and Heinz Beans.   Not the greatest F&E I have ever been to but not the worst either.
3uShDnXVPAX1_fZh1vBPZA : Ok. So. I am picky when it comes to döner or any Turkish food, since I cook this type of food often. Most Turkish restaurants in the U.S. just aren't good - either they Americanize the food to the point you can't recognize it, they focus on general "Middle Eastern food" that isn't even Turkish, or they are just yucky.  I'm shocked that there is a döner place in Austin period - but this is a great place! I tried the beef/lamb with garlic sauce (you have to do yogurt sauce - there's no other way!) and had cabbage, cucumbers and corn as garnish.   Here's what you need to know - it is a big portion, it tastes great, and it is authentic! The only negative is that they don't have Turkish coffee or desserts. I know it's owned by a German, but still. Turkish dessert and coffee would be a great addition. Chocolate covered fruit = generic and out of place. Me no like.
u5IIefHq-r9NTk-Z_kVwUg : Chapel Hill is a college town, therefore you will find many a hipster on Franklin street and haunting Time After Time. TAT has anything you could ask for. Retro glasses, leather jackets, cowboy boots, old lady sweaters, beach shorts, dresses, and the list goes on. You can find very trendy clothes at a good price. The prices, I must say, are even better than the prices at my local vintage store. For my birthday I received a yellow sweater from there and loved it. I also have two quintessentially "hip" glasses that I acquired at a great price. It's also great for Halloween and other costuming events.
wUUWbsl8VU5BH4IVSHph6g : Had them repair a cable for me, it was quick, the cost was reasonable, and most important, the work was top notch.
Bfy_RnMH8VBu_vZhyo5hjw : Hole in the wall Italian place, it's no Pasta Pomodoro or Caffe Del Stelle but it gets the job done. I ordered the Chicken Parmigano, and it was pretty good for what it is, if not cooked in butter and with a ton of cheese baked on it. But for $8 with a side salad and a soda, it's not a bad deal.   Strangely enough, it's in a food court by Cal that is mostly Asian dominated. It's a nice contrast.
bbaP7ygCxZKLn5qoK9PEdw : I really love the ambiance at cafe japengo. i love the food and service is very good. it's a little pricey, but worth it. Yes, Heather W is right, the bussers are pretty amazing there, better servicve than the waiters. Will definitely return.
eEPwcIbHS1BbTvy1Q2NeiA : My mother was a patient on 3west and in the ICU at  UCSD Thorton for almost 3 months. Her care was exceptional from the food service personal, Olivia,to the nursing assistants,charge nurse Martha, physicians, Dr. Castro and team! The nurse practitioner Deserei , plasmaphoresis nurse Debbie and especially the ICU nurse who comforted my mother while dying, Vickie! Your care and support during a very complicated time was so appreciated! I always felt that she was well cared for. All the way to the end! Bless each and every one of you!
LSkjHc2cWQVsXcaCoXb4KA : Don't come here expecting anything more than a doughy, greasy, and cheeeeeeeesy slice of pizza.  Mmmm....cheeeeese.  For the price, it's decent.    But whenever Fat Slice has $1.75/slice coupons in the Daily Cal, grab 'em and go!!!
GX_ZDKiAoilV5Wsuq7AJXQ : Their whole sandwich is actually two sandwiches! Not a problem since the turkey sandwich I ordered was DELICIOUS! I will definitely be back again and again. Can't wait to try their other sandwiches - this time I'll order a half and try one of their soups. Can't wait to go back.
m9Y7hcFgeuNOQ2m0_x3j9w : I stumbled across this bar one late night.  The atmosphere is great and the food is event better. I wanted to try everything on the menu. The crab and shrimp nachos are delicious. And its open late
O2H37aH9XrxciKxtacndbA : My husband and I walked in for a quick bite before catching a movie. We had only 45 minutes so we thought a nice restaurant was out of question, so we decided to give Russell House a shot - our expectation was to get something simple to eat and a beer. We checked in with the hostess and told her about our time restriction - she assured us we had plenty of time and quickly got us a nice table by the window. What a surprise when we saw the menu - so many interesting options! We settled for a few small plates to share: Serrano Ham with Honey Torched Manchego, Pork Rilette with Apple, Torched Tuna and a Little Leaf Salad with Figs and Walnuts.  Everything came out pretty quickly and the service was great - however we did let our server know that we had to catch a movie.  And the food was great! Very interesting flavor combinations, very competently prepared, and served without any fuss. My husband was pretty happy with the beer selection, and I had a glass of Wineport Rivers rose wine on tap (has anyone ever heard of wine on tap?).    So we were out of the door with 10 minutes to spare, with a budget friendly tab, and very happy stomachs. I can't wait to go back and try something else!
1oYRjcfOBeJDhFonqZWAiw : Chicken Tarna with extra garlic spread!!!   Recommendation: EXTRA GARLIC SPREAD
0_KaqS13FSuZMnGHPmxHig : This is an update on the waxing service:   I went back to Beautique for waxing and this round I was very observant... So observant that I was mortified to see that they double-dip their wax pots with the application stick when applying wax!   I'm sorry, that is incredibly unhygienic and just plain NASTY! I don't know about you but I don't want to come in and get my legs waxed and look down to see someone else's pubes on me from the wax they double dipped in!   GROOOOOOOOSS!
IP1Js8pQkdsoKvTR6QzjcA : After being introduced to Peet's a couple years ago, I can no longer enjoy Starbucks coffee. On top of having a superior brew of regular coffee, they have my favorite blended drink. Whenever I am in this plaza, I stop by for a Madagascar Vanilla Freddo. The employees here have mastered the technique of creating the perfect balanced blend. Best of all, it doesn't taste like they just pumped vanilla syrup into the drink. I hate that artificial and overtly sweet taste from syrup. I've also tried the other Freddos and I am particular fond of the ones with Scharffen Berger chocolate shavings. I think the secret to making these blended drinks so good is the bits of coffee chips, which gives the drink some texture. The only downside to getting coffee at this location is the parking. It is pretty terrible.
v3k30HEeH7a8IxFpdmRwgQ : I'm not a huge seafood person so I had the grilled chicken salad and it was amazing and huuuuge! Friends also enjoyed the seafood taco trio. They make a lot of their own sauces/dressing themselves. Full bar and excellent view of the city.
1V8VxtMwFpnpld1MsgwosQ : 3.5 stars!  i'm writing this review while enjoying my baked lobster roll :)  i've recently heard about delsushi from a friend of mine who seem to be very fond of this place. the idea of ordering sushi online and late night delivery is brilliant!!! so i've always wanted to give this place a try but it didn't start till 9p.m and i just don't wanna eat so late to gain weight. then i found out that they changed their hours to 7 - 3 & since im home alone and i dont wanna go out at all, i decided to order!  i ordered the baked lobster roll and dragon roll (i'm a fatass :( ). The delivery came about 40-45 mins after i place the order, which i think is pretty reasonable considering the making and driving time. i'm a fan of dragon rolls, & thats almost what i order everytime when i go to a sushi place. i dont really care for the dragon roll from delsushi cause i feel like i have had way better ones from other restaurants. The bake lobster roll, in opinion, was pretty satisfying. i feel like the rice that they use to make the rolls was kinda hard. i'm not sure if its the rice itself or because of the waiting time.   overall, i do feel like i would order from delsushi again whenever i'm lazy to go out or feel like sushi at midnight!
VGCL-8yWg2yvRMzacHQ31g : I have been attending Claremont Eye Associates for several years.  They have excellent doctors with reasonable fees.   Yes, routine eye exams are done by trained technicians, who report the results to the doctor.  The doctor then talks to you later on the results submitted to him.  If there is a concern, he will let you know and arrange followups. If the doctor decides to do every routine testing, surely the costs would go up, and the number of patients he can see will be reduced.   I haven't had any problem of insurance not being billed or being asked for paying charges that insurance covers. Besides, the doctors are very personable,  the front desk and technicians reasonably personable.  Wish I can say that for the gentleman selling the eye-glasses near the front office.  Also, wish the front desk would fore-warn me that my eyes will be dilated next visit so I can bring someone to drive me back home.  But that has not been a problem, because after about 20 minutes or so, I can drive with sunshades,  but with some difficulty.  Overall, I strongly recommend the office.  Ranji G.
OpL5FtuIEXCQar7wBHCKwg : WHAT I GOT:  Regular-Sized Roast Beef Sandwich on Dutch Crunch Bread with Provolone, everything on it except mayo, and extra Garlic Sauce!  Good lord. That's what I have to say about that. Good. Lord. Skip these next two paragraphs if you don't want to read my rant about sandwiches, and just want my take on my meal.   SANDWICH RANT:  You know, I've pretty much always hated sandwiches. I still hate most deli sliced turkey and chicken for some reason, but that's off the point. I should amend my statement to: I used to THINK I've always pretty much hated sandwiches. The truth is, I used to think I hated sandwiches because my image of a sandwich always used to be a couple slices of deli meat, a slice of American cheese, mustard and mayo between two crappy pieces of store-bought sliced bread. To some people, that's a decent lunch. Not to me.  You have to have something of substance; some great flavors to burst through the bread. And you have to have good bread! Examples: Philly cheese steak sandwiches, sausage and peppers/onions sandwiches, paninis, and meatball wedges. All flavorful and unique sandwiches. You gotta have the flavors, and it has to be balanced. If the filling overwhelms the sandwich, it can still be good. But if the bread overwhelms the sandwich, it's almost never good. The perfect sandwich has a filling in which all of its ingredients are balanced well, and the filling as an entity is balanced well with the good bread it should occupy. Here's an irony: my first two reviews on Yelp are of sandwich joints. End sandwich rant.  FOOD REVIEW:  The sandwich was friggin' great, and plenty to eat to boot. I ate half for lunch and half for dinner and was the perfect amount of "full" after each sitting. The roast beef itself was tender and flavorful, yet very lean. The meat portions are weighed (and therefore probably very consistent), and very generous as well. The sandwich was very flavorful (and zingy, see next paragraph) and the specialty Dutch Crunch bread did not disappoint.  My girlfriend got a turkey sandwich with everything on it, and that was great too from the couple bites I took. The difference seemed to be that the extra garlic sauce and lack of mayo gave mine more of a spicy kick, but that was fine by me. So if you want zing, go for the extra garlic sauce - if you want a more well balanced flavor, just get everything on it. "Everything on it", IIRC, is lettuce, tomato, red onion, pickles, mayo, mustard, pepper sauce, and garlic sauce.   I sprung for a Dad's Root Beer too, which I haven't had for probably 12 years. I'm not a root beer or soda connoisseur by any means, but it was definitely tasty and complemented the sandwich well. They had a nice little selection of maybe 8 - 12 kinds of root beer, and a decent selection of single serving bags of chips (not included in the sandwich price) as well.  ATMOSPHERE:  The shop is tiny and there's not much room sit. A couple tables inside and a couple outside. It was well kept and clean though, and the service was friendly.  PRICE:  2 regular sized sandwiches, $6.25 each + $0.75 each for the addition of provolone, $2.00 for the 12oz. (glass bottle) root beer = $16.00 flat, no tax :)  Would definitely come back.
j38FP5dY6GeJJ9dbmIo1JQ : Holy crap - why didn't anyone tell me about the Grilled Chicken Sandwich with arugula, camembert and bacon? Why did I miss the grilled pesto squash and zucchini? I am not a hummus fan, but the stuff they put on our table was fantastic and may change my mind. What is my name, again? What year is it, anyway?  I can't believe I've lived in Houston for 10 years and have never tried this place before. Shame on me. One star deducted due to the chaotic service and long wait for the dishes to make it to our table.
MVpM4wjGrLcnWN60V1D0Ow : I've been here a few times, but the most recent experience was nothing like the others.  Unfortunately.  This last time I came  with my husband, Mom, and siblings when we were all in town together.  Unlike my other visits, the food wasn't very good.  I had the pad se ew, and they really played up the ew side.  In the past it was flavorful and fresh tasting, but not so much the other night.  And my husband had the yellow curry, and the only flavor it had was salt.  And a lot of it.  Also, this place is a bit pricey, as far as Thai food goes.  I'm used to spending like $8-$10 an entreee, but Thai Palace comes in at around $14-$16.  And as other reviewers mentioned, the serving sizes aren't that large, so it's not like you get a bonus lunch out of it.  All in all, I will definitely branch out to another Thai place next time I'm in town.  And in the meantime, I'm grateful that I live in Santa Cruz, where good, cheap Thai food is easy to come by!
xL3Y52PKpJZJB0GRohr-eQ : Service is great, food is typical. I'd give em three stars but they didn't charge me happy hour price during happy hour so I'm mad.   Props for having a beer alternative to coors and bud, their islands brew is not too bad. Also, well done with the free chips and salsa too.   Staff is always friendly, as others have noted. There are better places for burgers in la jolla, and the food is typical greasy stuff.   ...meh..2 stars
spsKZHsyWxX8Bvr3suYf5A : Le Monde has gotten so much better over the years, but I still mostly just come for the burger, because it is a very good burger and it is accompanied by some really good fries.  And this is a great spot for brunch.  It serves up a ton of options, has less of a wait time than Community, and has a lot of space.  Finally, the table bread is great: sourdough, often brought to you hot.  Mmmmmmm....
MvAR6_tp3oIz-KBmLhr7sA : Really great food, interesting unique cocktails and a great atmosphere.  My boyfriend and I come here on special occasions because it's a tad on the pricey side, but it's worth it!  Their lasagna is easily the best dish on their menu.
X0JfecNZ4WEEXw1ioM3M9A : I've been here twice now --- both with a great experience from the same student. I don't want to pay $40 for a simple haircut like at most other Ann Arbor salons. So this place was recommended to me by a friend. I thought... what the hell, I'll give it it shot.  At first I was a bit nervous because someone in training is cutting my hair. But Missy was fab. For $15, this is the best hair cutting experience I've ever had.  My wait has never been more than 5 minutes with an appointment. You wait downstairs and are usually offered complimentary water, tea or coffee. If you do wait, make the most of your time and try on some hand creme. You'll need it once you go back outside in the cold.  Then typically your student picks you up. Everything has to get cleared by their instructor and everything takes place. This is what usually happens:  - Oil Scalp Massage. - Shampoo of Hair - Hair cut - Rinse of Hair. - Approval of Instructor... and you're on your way.  My first experience was an hour. But that's cool because I didn't have anything to do. My next experience was quicker, because Missy had set a goal to get a bit quicker, which showed. They won't even let you tip. I would totally go back. My favorite thing about this place is the fact that they are open pretty late. :)
_-klL0Ryp0QqSUo5XiNbIA : They charge you 2 dollars for water, and they don't take credit cards (with the obligatory pay-per-play ATM in the restaurant). Failing those two tests just makes this an annoying place. And now that I think of it, it was listed as 10 dollars but was 13 dollars. What a rip off.
kJi1N3AklH1X3WnF9eGJrg : This is hands down the best Indian food I have had in US. Being raised in India and now settled in US, I have tried many Indian/Pakistani restaurants hoping to find one which reminds me of food back home. Most of these restaurants end up having the same taste. This is where Karavalli is different and brings a unique taste to Indian food. The broad theme across the menu is south Indian with a few east-indian (Calcutta) dishes thrown in. The best part is that when they indicate something is spicy; it really is, without losing any of the flavor. The staff is very attentive and know what they are cooking and serving. The ambiance is nothing to talk about but then who cares when the food is do great.  Prices are little bit on the higher side for an Indian restaurant. My personal favorites are Fried Okra and Biryani. Also their kulfi(dessert) is pretty good. If you think you can handle spicy food, I challenge you to try Phaal.
GPWEWDvliKKpq2eYd8waLw : Stopped by Whole Foods La Jolla on my back from Airport. Haven't been in six months. Wow. What a disappointment. The produce was seriously lacking. And here at a market that prides itself on quality, freshness and organics.   The fennel selection was very small. All the fennels were very small and frankly, showing their age. Plus, Whole Foods chopped the fronds off, not sure why they felt they needed to do this.  Shallots were also disappointing. Old, mushy and yucky.  Tomatoes? Don't make me go into it.   The store was dirty and seemed to be littered with displays that blocked the aisles. The cold cuts were all prepackaged and were not appealing. The white wine selection was disappointing too.   In an era where the major chains are adding organics, broadening wine selection and working hard to meet customer needs, this Whole Foods location seems to be going backwards and losing its edge. So sad to see.  This used to be our favorite place to shop for fresh produce, meats and seafood. A year ago it woulda earned five stars from us. But today... oh well.
DTLX77IJzs6s444CG8T8VA : What was I thinking straying from Basta Pasta??  We wanted delivery and it came timely (40 mins for 2 pasta dishes).... and then it all went down hill. I swear, I am not a wasteful person, but I actually threw out my dinner.  It was that bad. STAY AWAY from the vegetable lasagna.  It was atrocious...  a horrifying mess of chewy thick bland cheese and small bits of vegetables (I think??) somewhere in the mix.  A puddle of oil on the top made it THAT much more disgusting.    The garlic bread accompaniment was okay - but that doesn't really take any skill...   Never again!!!
guW3B_D2XaBNg4svasGL9w : Probably my favorite thing about this place is how fast it is. They literally have your sandwich made in like 2 minutes, it's beautiful. And the sandwiches are really good. I've never been unhappy with Jimmy Johns, it's perfect for drunk food, sober food, all food. I even had it for breakfast once.  Rather than having to fuck around with specifying EXACTLY what you want while they take ages moving the stupid sandwich down the line like at some OTHER sub shops, Jimmy Johns already knows what you want and they are not time wasters with your dinner. Plus it's not too expensive, and sometimes they accidentally give you free cheese. Turkey Tom all the way!
dLzHftYq4QetdjHVZLw9zQ : Oh holy crap. I didn't goto this school, but I wish I did for this bar alone. I celebrated a bachelorette party here with my girls on a Saturday and basically ANY drink you can think of was $1....ONE DOLLAR!!! I was blown away. These same drinks in the same solo cup in Chicago would have been $5-7....   Cheers to $1 drinks and getting good and drunk for the cost of 2 drinks back home!
catGUwkhBM9w1tPZ2sVtwQ : PT's (the new Lucy's) is a great lunch/dinner spot, as well as a fun bar. The burgers are what they are known for, and I recommend sticking with what they do best. It's good American food at its best.  In terms of the nightlife, PT's is host to a variety of special nights. Tuesdays are the most popular, with a $2 cover for half-price drinks. Yes, all drinks are half price. It's also a 90's themed music night, making it fun to go back and listen to all of the awful hits throughout the decade. 80s night is on Thursday, and on Monday and Wednesday they have specials on all domestic beer. Now that it is warm outside, the outdoor patio makes for a great place to go and sit with friends throughout the summer.
q_sgtDXcNUovEMOhvMaxIg : Posse East is a 4 star burger joint, nothing too fancy. It gets kudos for being in the right location, quite convenient for engineers at UT that don't want to walk all the way across campus to the eateries on the Drag.  The burgers are meaty and quite tasty, I'm not sure what the deal is, but they are juicy and have some heft without being too much. Fries are battered, and very good. When I was there, I think that the fries would have been good if I had gotten them fresh, but they were served a little bit outside of the ideal serving window - the service there is a bit on the slow side, but let's face it, you're not going to a place like this for a five star dining experience. The owner/manager(?) guy with the cowboy hat is friendly (along with the rest of the staff), even if he is a bit a hard to understand (even for a native Texan).  Long story short, you can't go wrong here, as long as you go in with the right expectations - this is a college bar/burger joint worth checking out.
idMojmobweRIhaf0Wz-Hig : I've been here a couple times now, and I've gotta say that this is one of those few places where I disagree with the Yelp community. It's open hella late (noon to midnight except an hour earlier on the weekdays), it's located right across from Sang Kee (perfect for an after-dinner whipped snack), and it's dirt cheap. I'm not a huge fan of getting a large amount of base yogurt, so I've started to get a little bit of it with a lot of fruit toppings. I'm surprised by how little I have to pay for a large amount of fruit given that the price is calculated by weight instead of qualitatively by item.   Staff are always super friendly and it's kept warm in the winter and cool in the summer. Couldn't ask for more spot-on froyo with fruit when you want it -now-.
GU6gcf6Vu3dYWyn2oEXnOA : 4.5 stars     The quality of the thin crust varies a lot from day to day, but on good days it's probably the best NY-Style thin-crust in Cambridge.    (I mean normal NY style-- i'm excluding Yuppie-Style a.k.a Metrosexual-Crust, a style which does have some talented interpreters in Cambridge, but it's just a different ballgame. Don't pretend you don't know what I'm talkin about! I'm talkin about IKEA pizza. Pizza that pairs with microbrew and your surprisingly boring Peace Corps stories. That stuff's popular in Cambridge. It's not bad-- it's just not the same genre.)
bMdh0cScJ8vWqc-EWjwNug : This is a good place to meet friends with toddlers.  Just get a table in the back; the kids can run around and you might end up with a little time to finish your conversation!
3z6420FCLJ2j0fez37nCfg : Came here around 7 on a Wednesday night and it was pretty busy, but not extremely packed. It's Rice Village so the parking sucks and the lot is valet only with a few self-park spots for to-go orders. Like others have said, the place is pretty yuppie, so I don't foresee myself ever going there for a sit-down meal anyway.  I had the chicken parmesan focaccia sandwich which came with a side wedge salad.  I've never really liked eggplant or mushrooms, but in the context of the sandwich, I actually enjoyed them. The chicken was well-cooked and not dry at all. The marinara sauce and cheese were delicious as well. The wedge salad was an added bonus. It took me a while to figure out the best approach for me to eat it, but the feta cheese dressing and fresh lettuce were a good supplement to my sandwich.  I also had a taste of the old-fashioned cheeseburger and fries. The burger was a little dry and pretty simple, but good nonetheless. The fries on the other hand were outstanding. I loved the seasoning on them and wished I had ordered some for myself.  If there were half stars, I'd give this place a 4.5/5. My only objections are to the parking situation and the pricing. It was a little more expensive than I would have liked, but the quality of the food and the restaurant environment sort of explains why.
NKVzpWKa33Dv_J1qlQYe1A : Whenever I'm strolling along the Drag, I can't help but stop into Wish. It's a really cute boutique with a variety of jewelry, purses, clothes, and shoes. I've never bought clothes there, because they're a bit pricey and I've never seen anything that especially stood out, but I've gotten a few bags (which were adorable but not the most durable) as well as inexpensive, fun earrings, and funky club shoes that have lasted a while. They actually had the hottest pair of heels there, in only one size, that tormented me for months. Every time I came in I was hopefuly that they would finally have my size. They never did . That and the less than great quality of the purses I bought are the reasons Wish only gets three stars from me.
5gsLmcbRGHrLh0nWBnfKlg : Huge servings. Juicy burgers, salads, and sides that won't disappoint. Great place for families, I bring my parents here all the time when they visit me. My mom isn't a burger person but she really enjoys Firestone's chicken burger. I love the heart clogging ABC (Avocado, bacon, cheese) burger, it's incredibly satisfying and manages to hit the spot when you're craving meat or something filling. They do good by providing a large array of sauces for their patrons, it's a great contrast to other fast food places (McDonald's) that rations out sauces for their chicken nuggets. Little things like that really makes the experience more enjoyable.
SOM8WnaDTAIPFnIcCA8dtw : Very nice friendly vibe here.  My only gripe about this restaurant is that they close a bit too early.  9pm on a weekend!!  That's pretty early in my book.  Service was great and the waiters weren't pushy at all even when it took us a while to order since we had to wait for other members of our party to arrive.    Pros:  Decently pricey food considering its nice decor and the Pasadena area.  I got the Pad See Ew for $8.95 which isn't too bad in my book.  It's a lot better in service, decor, presentation and about the same portion as Noodle Planet for roughly the same price.  I'd rather get my Pad See Ew here than at Noodle Planet.  I also tried some of the Daisy Noodle and Daisy Rice and they are pretty delishicioso!  A bit spicy by my standards but the rice and noodles were both very flavorful.  The Daisy noodle tasted like Pad Thai noodles drenched in a peanuty thousand island sauce.    Cons:  They close pretty early.  We got there around ~~8:40 and around 8:45-8:50, they were already telling us the kitchen is about to close and they will be taking their final orders.  Street parking isn't too hard to find.  There was plenty of street parking even on a weekend just around the block.    Another con is that the restaurant is kinda small and cramped.  had to scoot my chair in a couple times every now and then but it's no biggie.
Nxx_VIoXQZO8tsm1IZknBQ : A true book lover's bookshop. Like walking into an old library. Surrounded by leathery spines, dust and that musty old-book smell that makes any reader feel at home. Narrow passages for browsing, and bearded college professor types reading on stools. Books stacked haphazardly everywhere. The literary equivalent of a cup of coffee on a cold winter day.
NpcX7dUpdEo4Fnj5dCGU0g : Not sure who came up with this ingenious idea, but no more Bento Boxes = FAIL...Thats all I have to say...
bICi4CCSMoBlv3bz5m7HMA : "Pacci" is named after "Carpaccio" which is one of Pacci's specialty items ... except I'm not a big meat/cheese fan and so we got another app instead. Their menu changes daily so it's very likely you won't see the dishes below or the menu items online.  COMPLIMENTARY FOCACCIA & FLATBREAD CRACKERS I love flatbread crackers, and the sun-dried tomato tapenade was really the highlight. The tapanede also had Kalamata olives, garlic, capers, & olive oil. The really nice touch was giving us the recipe on a bookmark.  MUSSELS & CLAMS ($9) Best part was the anisette cream which I could see myself eating for dessert :) The sweet broth tasted great w/ the grilled crostini that came w/ the dish - it's unfortunate the bread was pretty charred but at least our server was great about bringing more bread which was in better condition :) There were only a few mussels & clams though, and they were small, too. Clams tasted good but the mussels tasted a little fishy. Regretted that we didn't get the Marinated Grilled Artichokes - next time! Might even consider getting the Kobe Beef Carpaccio. Our server raved about their Bruschetta which also sounded good.  AMUSE-BOUCHE Compliments of the chef, we got a taste of their fried wild mushroom risotto on goat cheese. Yum - you can never go wrong w/ fried :)  FETTUCCINI ($24) I got the fettuccini w/ mussels, clams, shrimp, arugula pesto, and red pepper puree - b/c it sounded the most interesting among the pastas. The presentation was very colorful. Best part was the jumbo-size shrimp w/ arugula pesto - yum! But mad at myself for ordering this after also getting the Mussels & Clams app. Mussels (still fishy) & clams same petite-size. Pasta was bland. I got the full portion which was generous but not enough to make two meals. Next time I might get the half-portion pasta ($14). Among the pastas, our server raved about the Mushroom Risotto and the Pappardelle Bolognese.  SEA SCALLOPS ($26) Scallops was the overwhelming Yelp favorite after reading all the reviews. I got a taste of my friend's, and I thought the scallops were very good, along with the wild mushroom risotto (yum), and then the sweet pea nage. Haha - this review is based on just one bite :)  HALIBUT ($28) I almost got this dish but glad I didn't b/c I thought the fish was bland. The halibut came w/ mushrooms, cherry tomatoes, grilled corn, and corn butter. Again, this is based on just one bite :) I probably should've dipped the fish in the corn butter :) But my friend enjoyed his dish so that's cool. Secretly though I hoped that he would've ordered the Rack of Lamb which our server raved about. Oh well - I'll have to get that next time, or convince my next dining partner to get it :)  Overall, I'd give Pacci 3.5 stars rounded to 4. Food was just 3 stars but it was the great ambiance and really excellent & genuine service that brought it to the top. Food presentation was good, too. The food is a little pricey though - definitely a special occasion place. Thanks Scoutmob for giving me a chance to check it out :) I'd definitely come back. The cocktail & dessert menu looked very tempting, too.  FYI - valet parking is complimentary. Just remember to get your ticket validated by your server. And since you're here anyway, you should check out the AltoRex rooftop bar esp. if the weather is really nice.
qEBiPabNOzLGzRNkrbrmvQ : Custard Danish! Hmmm, I used to love these as a kid, and still do. I don't go to Stanford Shopping Center as often as I used to, but when I'm there, I always stop here.  There's usually a chaotic line, but I can live with it.
Rn9L_T3xsL_5hCNkNO50ZQ : Another example of private schools privatizing their services to big corporations.  Do not let the trendy, "Coop" title fool you... this is indeed a Barnes & Noble Bookstore.  For MIT (and Harvard) contracting their business to a giant corporate entity -- minus two stars.  Now, in terms of cleverness and satisfying wit... I'd give a five star review.  Shirts with nifty mathematical and scientific equations... most referring to MIT.  The MIT shirt bearing the formulas for M, I, and T in a row is awfully cool... as well as the kids' "cutie [pi]" onesies.  IHTFP means "I hate this f'n place"... jsyk.  jsyk means "just so you know"... fyi  fyi means "for your information"... anyway...  Prices on clothing are the same as most college bookstores.  The book selection is majorly toned down compared to the big B&N stores.  The MIT Coop -- as long as you know you're actually shopping at a big retailer, it's quite a fun experience.
IyMdF3FPwqKcz6lIw5UKlQ : As a former UNC attendee, East End was one of my favorite bars to frequent. Sure, it helped that it was the closest to my dorm being a straight shot almost out of the back of Old West. But even more than that was the delicious martinis they served. My favorite was their Pineapple Upside Down martini. If you like pineapple, you'll love it.   Booths in the back offer a quieter place to hold a conversation with friends. Or if you're looking for a livelier night, sit at the bar or at one of the front tables where all the action is. Get in early though because this smaller establishment can get quite packed.  Being a martini bar I'm sure you can guess that it boasts a slightly higher drink price tag than some of the other Franklin Street establishments. But if you're going here, you're going for quality over quantity.  Non-greeks beware. This place tends to be a frequent hang out for those in fraternities and sororities. Even so, it's a great place to start off your night. Get in early or you might not get in at all.
fuc_fP4xEBZbHuChEy25JQ : I lived in Dryden my whole life, then went to school in Boston. The bagels from here / Collegetown Bagel are the (non-living) thing I miss most. I always order a plain bagel toasted twice with cream cheese, and they come out perfect.  Nothing in Boston compares. Bagels there are too thin, or never get toasted enough, or don't have enough cream cheese- and they get cut in half twice, which makes them harder to eat and carry. Boston seems like the logical place for these amazing Ithaca bagel places to expand- it's collegetown bagel, right? Boston is FULL of colleges! It fits!  I'm grateful to my parents. I know that as long as they live, even when I'm out of college and am entirely supporting myself, they'll still be doing something wonderful: living in Ithaca, giving me a reason go there (and a place to stay when I do)  and eat delicious bagels.
n1JvGRxtyiEFSlCOAXyzmg : There is nothing that they could do to make this place better. It is very good quality at very low prices.
lLQJr29ogoS9YNgZ1PEYRQ : for the price, their portions and quality are wonderful!  $7 for a chef salad that can feed two adults, COME ON.  i could barely finish half a sandwich. that is why they are always filled with people  2 complaints though: the soup sucks--they give you so little and it is watery, not good soup.  secondly, the sanitary/hygene of the kitchen is questionable. if you've been there u know what i mean. u see them treat the ingredients more like materials in a factory manufacture line. kinda sloppy.  but they deserve a soild 4 stars for their cheap, tasty food!
JCNceplx2y0nOxq2Knl-uw : I love Schultzy's for its beer selection as well as food selection.  Many places have good beer variety from Germany/ Belgium, etc etc, many places also have good food to go with beer, but Schultzy's is one of the few that combines the 2!  I also love their long hours (few restaurants serve food after 9) and specials of the day.  My absolute favorite from this place is definitely their chili cheese fries.  AWESOME CHILI CHEESE ON AWESOME FRIES IS AWESOME.  and I get to have Spaten?  This place is a no-brainer.  o and their crunchy wings are awesome too.  Best time to go is after 10 pm for their late night HH menu - cheap and effective.
lV9h4gUJPUn6LbsMYkVzyg : Yes, the pizza is horrible, but THE POKEY STICKS.  Oh my God, the pokey sticks.  Whoever invented these is a freaking genius.  Soft, doughy breadsticks smothered in garlic and melted cheese served with marinara and ranch.  I crave these at all hours of the day, they are that good.  If you haven't tried them yet, you are seriously missing out.
K9qfooKE1mVH89ZepodCog : I wondered whether I really belonged here.  After all, I hadn't leveraged any buyouts or rigged any energy markets before setting foot in the place.  The atmosphere (leather-bound wine lists, lots of fuss over the service) was a turn-off for me.  On the other hand, everything that I ordered was perfect.  For the record, I had the Sunday prime rib special with a caesar salad, a baked potato and a couple of local draft beers.
_eDH2TDM0rrCRQk_5oizQw : These are the best crepes I've had in Pittsburgh and several other big cities (D.C., Phila., Chicago).  The guy who makes the crepes is a true expert and watching him whip up dozens of crepes is so much fun! I get the egg and cheese crepe with added mushrooms and order with the garlic oil base.  They serve all of the savory crepes with a tiny side salad with mandarin orange slices.  Although it's small, its really a nice addition and the dressing is so good I dip my crepe in it.
iB2O2zdyJ1DMiAQ2E7rSDA : I've eaten here probably 50 times (I live across the street). It's decent, the food is rather inconsistent and the service is hit or miss.   My advice: stick to the pizza, or wings.   The other entree's are horrific (especially the tabouleh). Every time I've ordered a non-pizza dish I end up not even finishing it. Unless you like mediterranean food made without care, or skill--stick with the pizza, or wings.
f_TpMjr4WHFsf2AwP0eC7g : Went here once and the staff was very rude to my co-worker. He was visiting from India and struggling a bit to pay with the appropriate amount of money. Even though there was literally nobody else behind us, the staff acted like the soup nazi.   On top of that, the food was very bland. Will not go back here again.
SiPD2fwQTAfgmWR1lq2LUQ : I've passed by Blue Leaf many (many) times on my way to Sephora, and once the word "stationery" registered in my mind (it's above the Blue Leaf windows--no other words really registered), I hopped my way in.  Blue Leaf is remniscent of Kuhl-Linscomb--there are furniture and home trimmings, but gifts and knickknacks. To the wall on the far left, you have your fancy schmancy lotions (e.g. Mor, Jo Malone) and stationery (Vera Wang, Kate Spade, Crane & Co.). With Kuhl-Linscomb, you definitely get the feeling that you're in a retail space. However, with the dim lighting, preponderance of dark wood furniture, and smaller second level, which sometimes doesn't have anyone working up there, I felt like I was in the "castle" in "My Little Princess." Wait--isn't that a horse? What's that book/movie where the girl is up in a tower, but pretends she's a princess, and turns out to be a princess, never mind that that story line runs in just about every fairy tale? "A Little Princess"! Thank you, Google.  There are two staircases, one in the middle and one on the right. One has fun notebooks at the bottom of the staircase. I now own a glittery moose notebook (kitsch is always cool) and a cherry blossom notebook. Though, I had bought some cherry blossom paper and a blank notebook at Paper Source, determined to make my own notebooks, only to realize that had cost more than the one from Blue Leaf. Damn. On the second floor, you have individual greeting cards, gifts for your dog, fun/tacky gifts, books, perfume, smaller and more expensive gifts (such as a hand-carved chess set--more than a grand is all I remember), and things to go on your bed (excluding Fabio).  Blue Leaf is fun to browse, though it gives me various heart-attack inducing moments (oh, that looks nice *flips over to look at price tag* ack, ack, okay, time to go look at some cards).
IP4u-YPJKFe0CzqEq8-FdA : I can't believe I lived 30 minutes away from this place for the majority of my life and I barely try it now that I live in Los Angeles.  I know Tri Tip, growing up in Santa Maria, it was a weekend staple.   My boyfriend and I went here, wanting to try a few things on the menu. We ordered a the tri tip sandwich and the pork rib meal. And we thought this wasn't going to be THAT much food.  It was TOO much food.  The rib meal came with a "side" of garlic bread and a "side" of fries. The side of garlic bread was about half a loaf of bread, and a pound of fries.  Everything was so delicious.  Tri-tip sandwich: The tri tip had no fat, but was juicy and tender. The bread that the tri tip is on is grilled to perfection. The seasonings were just right, and not too much BBQ Sauce. The BBQ sauce was devine.  Pork Ribs: We got 7 bones with our meal, but they were meaty, which isn't usually the case for pork ribs. They were so tender and perfectly cooked.  Bread: Delicious.  French Fries: Golden and Crispy, not greesy!  Can't wait to come here again!!   The service was quick, it's not a waiter service restaurant. You order yourself, call your number, take it back to the table. But it was fast and we could get our refills by ourselves which is how we like it!    ONE TIP: ADD A BARBEQUE SAUCE STATION SO WE DON'T HAVE TO ASK FOR IT.
4-kSFhMvAjnSio8wmGdPTg : My Husband and I were extremely lucky to find  Michael and have him photograph our wedding and engagement photos last year.  We really wanted a photographer that was artistically talented  and not only new how to use a camera but could create beautiful layouts and really capture our special day.  Michael was so easy to work with and took all our wants and wishes and really made them happen.  We were really pleased. Just check our his website and portfolio and you can tell that his pictures are works of art using lighting, color and talent to create images that you can treasure for a lifetime.
7xXN6JqiQx228dBsVDU-EQ : Average Americanized, Americanized Chinese food.  It does the trick when you're eating your way across campus to your next class or meeting.  And who doesn't like orange chicken?
k_VodyjI2Gskq_dm-2Re9A : Delicious Sicilian sandwich calls me at all hours of the day!  The women there during the 9-5 hours are pleasant and friendly.  Their pesto has whole pine nuts which I don't mind and the croissants are delicious.  It never seems too crowded to pick a comfy spot and blast through a full day of work.
gGpHpArbCzEX_ofUQd9swQ : The pizza is cheap but so is the quality.  The dough is very much like cardboard and their toppings are sub-par.  If you want cheap pizza I'd recommend to go to Cici's because this place is really a waste of money.  I can't comment on the Pokey sticks because I never ended up trying it.  I ordered pizza here once and said never again.
7bLFRuy5ic0VMy4GBxRBMQ : This place has a great selection of wine and is reasonably priced. The owner is super-friendly, very passionate about wine, and is extremely helpful when you're not sure what type of wine to buy. Definitely worth checking out.
w4fT9Y8rczFqnFEipzuO0w : The food is all right, though I don't think the prices are reasonable. Of course the margaritas are a tradition for newly 21-year-old CP students to try, even though they're not that great. I guess you don't really go there for the food, so it doesn't need to be that great, anyway. The wait staff is all right; you just have to make sure you can grab their attention while they're running around.
HecQRAb0RGm4vK7GqgMecw : Okay, so the high rating is a bit biased.  This has been the only place I've found in Houston that serves Pisco Sours, a Peruvian specialty drink.  They are the Peruvian version of a margarita, but way stronger and a lot better tasting.  The rest of the drinks we had there (yes, we made our friend do the disgusting cement mixer as a birthday gift) were okay and not really overpriced.  However, the clientele was a bit lacking.  It had a frat daddy feel to it and there was no waiter service.  And even though there was plenty of room to move around and enough seats, everyone was crowded around the bar making it near impossible to get drinks.  I think the highlight of the night (besides the Pisco Sour) was having a very drunk girl tell me (who'd only had two drinks in a two hour period) to not drive drunk.  It was adorable and endearing.
dGG_QQnBpVSQ7hkFXZc06w : Over-priced chain deli food... All the locations are pretty much the same quality and service (average). Its a decent place to have a business lunch and they have enough options on the menu to keep people content. Nothing super spectacular though.
rNBEkvuIFTNW9Q-ONvaKBg : Love the atmosphere here for drinks. Small, cozy, funky, cool, with attentive (and really cool!) bartenders and delicious drinks. I was especially taken with the mojito, which was nicely homemade and muddled properly. Fun for a casual drink with friends to start out the night or a date, I'm a fan.
-P2trOjuq3Jk6qe4eQz_aQ : One of the gems of Harvard Square.  Isn't one of those comic book shops that's about the toys and trading card games and tabletop RPGs.  It's all comics and graphic novels and books and magazines about the above.  (Well, there are a few random books that seem out of place, but 99% of the tiny, packed space is about comics.)  The prices can be a little steep, but it's worth it to keep shops like this around.  At least, that's how I explain their scary effectiveness when it comes to parting me from my money.
Srpz5ysIE4GsfuZqJlDVyg : I must say that this is some genius and unique idea of a business and after passing it up so many times, I finally got to try my first bite of this praised ice cream sandwich. Now before ordering, the staff maintained a fun atmosphere by singing and dancing along to the good selection of music, which made me want to join them and it sure looked like they enjoyed their job.   When I got my strawberry shortcake ice cream sandwiched between two chocolate  turtle cookies, I was speechless. The guy at the cash register asked me how was it and all I could give him was a thumbs up. Turns out I had chocolate all over my face and my sister didn't bother to tell me until after that confrontation with the cashier, but the cookies were warm and gooey and delicious. It's like a pizookie, only better. Yes, this did defeat my workout that I did this morning, but it was so good and so worth it!
lFpJCUR5HKAAE39Gp1cw1g : This place sucks.  It's dirt cheap though.
-KtcMdsXwx022LJFN3OZIA : I see in my future...another $12 (sans blow dry) chop-to-the-locks....or a future body wave at Aveda Institute....  I don't have anything special to say about my student hairdresser, Margo, except that I was very content with her work on my thick, black Asian hair (relatively easy to work with).   Note: I asked my student hairdresser up front what kind of style she's been doing a lot, and since I'm not picky about style -- just length --, I had her do what she's already done to many of her customers: long layers.   General vibe was that the students are not here to snip and then shove you off their barber seats -- in fact, they're very accommodating to late-in-the-haircut requests (Margo asked me how I liked my "finished" hair, and I then asked her to cut off another inch. No biggie!).  Scalp massage, tea, $12 on my Visa, and low-key. Let your lunch hour feed on THAT!
q4uCUMvkNjAets3lWCkUuQ : Certainly the best wine store in the neighborhood, and probably one of the best I've been to, especially considering its size. Without trying to sound stuffy, I have some formal training in enology and viniculture, too; I am not a casual wine buyer, however I haven't been disappointed with any of my selections from The Winery. The shop is small and only distributes high-quality but inexpensive (less than $20) wines that haven't quite been discovered yet (when they do get discovered and jump above $20, the store will switch to a different yet comparable wine). All of your purchases are stored in the database if you create a customer profile (unless you prefer otherwise), so you can browse your wine history if you forget the name of something you've had in the past.
fFUCn-KRy0OM5RUuEB4VEw : Restaurants don't appear to stick around very long on this little section of Green St., so I'm hoping this place stays. There are other places you could go to for Mexican food that are closer to campus, but everything here is so fresh and yummy, not to mention you'd be supporting the nice guys who run the place.
CPek6P-OsyqMOe-ltoVZAw : A few years after I'd been to UPenn (for a conference), I finally get to try Wawa.  Brother and I stopped by for a quick breakfast.  Can I just say, I love the electronic ordering thing?  There's no way for anyone to screw up your order, because they print out directions on how to make your sandwich--including what order to put the ingredients, when to toast, etc.  Their blended coffee was only ok (too icy, and the flavor was not wonderful...but it still hit the spot).  Their sandwiches were tasty though (I got a ham egg and cheese...my brother got something much more complicated), and they were fairly cheap.  Wish the staff was nicer, but...whatever, i'm not looking for service.  Solid food, fair prices, and it's like a block away from my brother's place.  awesome.
Dtv1W_TsxfCySBCyVQii2Q : This is definitely the best coffee place on the UCSD campus! I go here almost ever morning I have work. It's a quiet setting, which makes it great for studying during the year. The workers are really friendly, and they are always down to make conversation. Ask them about any of their drinks, and they will give you an honest opinion. If they don't know about the drink then most likely they will give you a free sample, and ohhh buddyyyy do I loooove ANYTHING that's free!!!...well almost anything =P   I definitely recommend the Ice caramel macchiato, because out of all the coffee shops I've been too this place makes it the best. If you plan on studying, I recommend going upstairs, because there is plenty of seating. Just try to stay away from the couches, because those will knock you out instantly and you won't get any work done (trust me..I know from experience)
RdwxxMofpMTkrtNgOQU_GA : Tommy Doyle's was much better the second year around for our event, but I still wish they provided more food for our guests. Once again, not enough fried food to go around, and I don't think they refilled the trays more than once...
dDX1gLkcYlw4EtxRldaLFw : I like working out at the JCC, although I do have a premier membership.  The locker rooms are clean, and they always have clean towels on hand.  The gym is never crowded which is a huge plus in my opinion.  I'm not sure why it's gotten such a low review from others.  I've never had a problem there before, and the staff has always been super friendly and helpful.  I've had several personal training classes there, and they always met my expectations.  I love their fitness classes as well, especially zumba.  The instructors are always motivational and friendly.  I've been a member here for 2 years now.
sOP1F_ZmsuTlWu03lAGPUQ : This is one of my favorite pubs in Austin. Great location - just north of the UT campus. Very good beer selection, good pub grub, and the people are friendly. Prices are excellent, much better than downtown locations. Definitely a great place to relax and wind down after a long day. I always look forward to our visits here.
wjT204Ezn4gv0gC5XshZuQ : I love PPR.  Belying the name, PPR is perfect for the amateur hobbyist who wants to use a nice piece of glass every once in a while.  There are a few lenses that I just LOVE the bokeh on, but being a pure amateur there's no way I can afford them.  PPR lets me rent them for $30-50 and I can produce creamy bokeh all day long.    Quick note on that price -- that's for the really high end lenses, the ones that msrp higher than $2k.  They've got a number of lenses for much cheaper than that.  To Ari E.'s point, yes, the application is comprehensive.  If I were running a rental place where I let people walk out the door with thousands of dollars worth of equipment for just tens of their dollars, yah, I'd have an application this comprehensive as well.  A credit card temp hold doesn't guarantee anything (even in NYC!).  PPR has reasonable weekend rates (pickup the lens in the afternoon on Friday, return Monday morning for a one day rate) and weekly rates that are only 3 times the daily...perfect for the vacation crowd too.
HCbulYK_jU0Pqr7R_Od9Bw : WORST MEAL EVER!!! My dad is a big fan of Jewish Delis, corned beef in particular. He swears by Langers, and if he got to pick his last meal It would be their corned beef or Monte Cristo with Russian Dressing.   On Friday after a night of Mexican B-Movie nostaligia watching "Spaceship of Monsters."My pops, sis, and I were ravenous. My dad saw a deli and his eyes light up like a kid in a candy store, or rather and older Mexican dude in a brined meats store. Alas, poor father had the worst corned beef of his life at Jerry's. It was dry and salty as hell. The bread was super mushy and crumbly. WHAT THE F___?!   My sister's turkey sandwich, dryer than kitty litter. My meatloaf sandwich was inedible. It was reminiscent of something sinister from my childhood. What?? than it came to me Chef Boyardee / Spaghettio meat. That's wtf it tasted like, salty, crackers & cardboard dyed brown.   There was definatley a theme to the meals tho. It's called salt, Because it seemed everything was dipped in the Red Sea before being served, WTF??? The only thing not super salty? My French fries.   Our poor waiter could tell we hated the food. I'm so sorry you have to serve that up dude. It can't help your self respect. My sis asked what they were famous for and when he said corned beef I nearly died trying to stifle my laughter. Jerry - seriously hang it up.   We gave some poor homeless guy high blood pressure by sticking him with our left overs - $54 bucks worth of iodized salt.
lJTeZ4bdx1_3-D1Qtgt2og : I only regret that I discovered this place late in my college career.  I seriously dream of these wings!  I go to their website regularly in the hopes of finding a location nearby.  I was so excited when they opened a location in NYC and cried a few months later when it closed.   Visiting this place while on a trip back to Ithaca was the highlight of my vacation.  Oh boneless wings - how I've missed you!  Your juicy meat and your delicious flavor - we had many good times together and I hope others enjoy you as much as I did.
rX7RKvkf6UqqDgBqihpcNA : This is one of my favorites in Troy. We went here a lot when I was at RPI for both lunch and dinner.   The inside has a very cool and traditional decor. Its not too flashy, nothing like a  fancy restaurant but its nice. Parking can be tough sometimes, you have to park on 15th street where its usually packed.But I generally park on the side of the building or behind it. To this day, I honestly do not know if that's legal parking, because the area behind looks like its parking for the house/apartments there. But so far I never got towed so it should be ok.   Now on to the food. The food here is great , I actually never had a bad experience with it. With most dinners you get the large lavash bread, which is simply amazing, its straight out of the brick oven (literally). For the food my all time favorite is the beef durum (or gyro as most other places call it) I also had the chicken with cury and gyro pizza, both of which were also good.  The prices are more than reasonable last time I went  for lunch with my friend, we got two durums, small lavash bread, drink and baklava for about $25, it was more than enough food for 2 people.   This is definitely my favorite place for lunch in Troy that's close to rpi campus. I would recommend it to anyone who love Mediterranean food like I do.
XPBnsad3WnjwQq2JL1_xkQ : Our family came back here after a previous visit 7 years ago. The first time was memorable because two of us were stung by bees on the lawn outside. No comparable drama this time. Good food, fun atmosphere. I enjoyed the calamari appetizer, and the crabcake entree was great. We'll come back next time we're in Ithaca.
w4BZe4E9WI2DSZsa8omcaQ : Mahogany Grill is your typical American grill / pub style restaurant where the food is decent and the service is good.    My boyfriend and I selected this place for dinner on our first night in Ithaca during a week long vacation up in the Finger Lakes this past July.  The atmosphere was nice - it was a beautiful night out, so we decided to eat outdoors in the sidewalk cafe area.  We ordered a nice bottle of local wine to start (a Glenora Vineyards cabernet franc), which was a nice, solid bottle of red at a reasonable price.  We started off with the zucchini stack, which was flavorful and crispy.  We also chose one of the special apps; the "dank and unruly" wings.  With a name like that, we were expecting super spicy wings covered in a dark sauce, popping with flavor.  What we got was some chicken wings covered in a very light, citrus honey sauce.  They should have been called "Summer Wings" instead because they were neither dank nor unruly!  When we gave our honest feedback to the waiter, he seemed surprised that they were not what we were expecting and unemphatically agreed to bring us more sauce to see if that would help boost the flavor (most unfortunately, it did not).   For the main course, I had the cast iron seared Jail Island salmon (with mashed potatoes and asparagus), which was delicious.  My boyfriend had the filet medallions Oscar (with mashed potatoes and creamed corn), which he really enjoyed as well.    Overall, we really did enjoy our experience here.  The service is reliable, but not great.  The food is very good, but a bit overpriced for a grill style restaurant in Ithaca.
x4s6SOQ_anyySD_Y20LcxQ : Appetizers: yellowfin tuna tartare, mushroom soup, scallop. Main: Trout, Arctic Char
iQYNu4n8mCJ8k8Qy6mCSLA : I was thinking about the best way to describe my experience at Cambridge 1. All I can say is that is was the best thin crust pizza I have ever had.
sV7K83nFdrA7Bwvgu7zrCQ : Being from Texas, I do agree that this is not the most authentic Tex-Mex out there, but its certainly among the best and most consistent you're going to find in Boston.  Margaritas are good, service is solid, and you'll get stuffed (with a buzz!) even on a budget.  On weekend nights, it's definitely a fun place to go and a get a few drinks with friends.
DoPPqrn1EJujdr-OZDp5cw : YUMMMMMMMMMMMMM!!! Chips and homemade guacamole is a FANTASTIC way to start a meal. The Chicken Bandera is wonderful and the corn and black bean empanadas are awesome!!! Add a few of their margaritas to your meal and you will be a very happy person!
jYqWDLVFCVJ5xyaUNWN0Nw : Decent sushi at a decent price. 20% off on Sundays & Wednesdays! Their spicy sushi roll is very good
J6SPLA6wcCldCv_Trojm9g : This is a hidden gem!  Maybe it's hidden because it's not really in Brookline ... it's on Brookline Street.  Misleading much?  It's a Lebanese-run brunch place, and while I haven't had any of the Lebanese food yet, the brunch menu is pretty standard and meets expectations =]  The portion sizes are huge for $6 or 7.  I ordered the French toast with ham last Saturday, and while the ham was great, the French toast and maple syrup combination tasted a little artificial.  Overall, though, not bad!  DO NOT get the baklava.  True, it also comes in a huge portion size.  But it looks as if they just bought it from a wholesaler and cut it up for you, and that's supported by how it tastes -- easily broken into a dense bottom and flaky top, and also too artificially-sweet.  I'd still check it out, though!
RIWSPUdLRRppqUAy2Yizjw : I started coming to Catena's right after high school. (Before then I'd prided myself on not spending more than $12 on a haircut.)  I had grown my hair out to the longest it had ever been and asked my mother if she knew where I could donate to Locks of Love.  My mom asked her hair dresser at Catena's (owner MaryAnn), and it turned out SHE participated in Locks of Love.  So I went to get my 10 inches cut off in little braids, she styled my super-short new length beautifully, and I haven't been to another salon in Austin since.  I saw MaryAnn all through college when I came back to Austin for breaks.  Despite my vague descriptions of styles I wanted, she always came up with something I loved and complimented my face.  About three years ago, I came to my appointment with a scary thought: getting my hair highlighted for the first time.  My hair's always been blonde, but as I've become a "grown-up" and spent less and less time outside in the sun, my hair has darkened a little too far past dirty blonde than I would like.  I had no idea what type/color of highlights to do, but MaryAnn worked her magic and my hair color looked like mine again.  MaryAnn doesn't work on Saturdays (perk of being the owner), and now that I work weekdays, I can't ever find a time during the week to see her.  About a year and a half ago, I started seeing another of their stylists, Shelley, who has also become my therapist.  Although MaryAnn is wonderful and incredibly skilled, she's also my mother's age.  Shelley is much closer to my age, and we have a great time chatting about our families, boys, lives, etc.  I look forward to going to get my hair done every time.  She keeps my color specifics and past cuts on an index card (this really impressed me), so she doesn't have to ask what I want done if I just want the same thing.  She's also given me incredible advice about styling my hair and maintaining my color and texture in between visits.    The salon itself is very cozy and welcoming, and although it comes off as a very fancy place at first, the price is right.  I've never paid more than $100 for my cut and partial-color.  I really can't say enough good things about this place.  I'll be sad if my life ever takes me away from Austin for many reasons, but Catena's would be at the top of that list!
cxTwjqENxp0gKHrozHdEUw : In the cheese steak debates of the 215, leave Abner's out. While this place, and their penchant for UPenn/Drexel mens & womens' basketball has kept it relevant, it's about the last place you want to get your grease.  I've always found their service to be mirrored after Pat's/Geno's, and yet there ISN'T a line likely to be behind you, so the rudeness is purely for aesthetics. Equally, the food is easily forgettable - provided you don't have a bad experience. The ambiance is crappy '80s Philly sports memorabilia,  blaring TVs with ESPN, and slippery floors and tables.   I'd order off of a truck any day before wasting my time or cash here.
GbNYNt4wyMxCD8uY1N3wlA : I came here last week for dinner before a long night of drinking, and it was definitely the right thing to do!   I ordered the spicy pork plate and it was delicious, but spicy! Definitely not for the faint at heart! All the rice and vegetables are a great compliment for a tender, spicy pork that will have your taste buds on their toes!   Best bang for the buck with outside seating!
ytSKI45W9S8EXencR8caXQ : The food is usually good there but on one occasion I ordered a piece of cake for desert and since the play is darkly lit, it too a couple of bites to realize the cake was moldy! The waitress seemed horrified and was extremely apologetic. She took it off the bill and offered another desert but I declined. It makes you wonder what other food they have back there that is clearly old. I've been once since just for drinks but it so crowded we left after one drink.
6RdcVUQnOfUTk06igP_3ZQ : We ended up at the location in Cambridge, MA just by chance.  It's in a food court like area, hope this is the right location.    Husband got a lobster roll and a cup of New England chowder.  It's generic lobster probably from Costco, but fine.  Chowder was decent.  Think he told me it was $11 for the roll & chowder.
V_jjJWhS6xBq5pFPPes-oA : Had a wonderful dinner here.  Highly recommended if you are in Atlanta.
F59XlJdfOPkOkauzqZqQFA : The selection, portions, and quality have seriously declined in the past 6 months. I've heard many reports that the fish is always a bad choice.  Now the only reliably decent thing is the salad...  Not worth the price.
w9WTHeQUU3HS3wlw37rVdA : Every holiday means Some Crust Croissants in my family. Easter dinner included these bad boys and they are yum-diggity every time. They are great alone, with butter....with fresh raspberry jam....I have even put Nutella chocolate/hazelnut spread on them. They are seriously bigger than my hand and sooooo buttery my arteries clog with every bite. You can make a meal out of one....and are great for making jumbo-tronic sandwiches.  They have great cakes, too. For Easter we had a lemon cake with a citrus center, the icing was light and airy.....a whipped topping....not too sugary and was beautiful, to boot.  Cookies TO DIE FOR! There is NOTHING here that is bad....ever....and more importantly over the course of my life everything tastes the same.....total and complete consistency....now that's impressive.
eOpwWIq0Vxw_wTSarEnfWQ : I had lunch at Sonrisa one weekend after doing some shopping at UVillage.  First I'll say the service was okay, but not excellent.  We sat in the bar, but didn't have anything to drink so I can't comment on the quality of the drinks.  I had the chicken and chorizo burrito.  First let me say that I'm not usually a fan of mexican, or I guess tex-mex in general.  Although I try to enjoy all food at least somewhat.  I can't imagine their being that many ways to cook a burrito, you have a tortilla and some combination of meats, rice, beans, pico de gallo or other vegetables.  I appreciated the freshness of the pico and spinach they put in mine.  The chicken and sausage were well cooked, and the chicken had a nice char broil on it without being dry.  The presentation was okay too, nice white plate, cloth napkins.  The burrito was placed on a bed of melted cheese with sour cream drizzled across it.  There were also mounds of sour cream and guacamole.  Nothing was particularly exceptional, but it seemed freshly made, they didn't have the consistency of coming 'right' out of the fridge that I've had at other places.  Considering how it seems there aren't a lot of 'authentic' or a particularly competitive market for mexican food here in Seattle, I guess Sonrisa isn't bad.  I appreciated the freshness, and the nice decor.  The place is clean, the food's cooked with enough skill and attention to never be terrible.  At least not when I was there.  If it's by the people who do the Ram Restaurants you probably need to know that before hand to know what you're getting.  Kind of expensive, sort-of mediocre yuppie tex-mex.
RjfzMlT4mQj9UctKyOCPDA : I don't know why people keep talking about the pizza. The pizza is good, if you like the crisp-tender style of crust rather than the crunchy-chewy kind, but what blows my mind here is the BURGER SPECIAL.  These burgers give me a funny feeling inside. And the fries make me tingle.  They actually season the meat, which is something that even home cooks don't always know to do. The bun is awesome. And holy hell the special sauce. Once I got some kind of garlic cilantro mayo and another time some kind of chipotle mayo. Laid on thick. Maybe it was even Miracle Whip because it would not be toned down.... I'm getting tears in my eyes right now. Some kind of awesome cheese. Lettuce, tomatoes. Comes with fries with yummy seasoning.  Not every burger has the magic mayo; once I got a special which had salsa and avocado. Still the best patty out there.  I've been a Bartley's fan for years, but this is hands-down the better burger. Get the special!!!
HSuoX4KZv0g4ArAkOAr5xw : Food is tasty, but the portion is a tease. I want to go back and ask for seconds. Don't let the pictures on the truck fool you. You might be lucky walking away with two bite size pieces of chicken. But, perhaps I'm just a greedy American. This is probably a proper lunch size in India.
Kgp31vhnTeSL5Y_kiO18yA : Not a great option with all the great Indian restaurants around, but decent enough, and it gets a star for free delivery through campusfood.com.  update: loses a star for delivering poor, bland tandoori salmon when i ordered tandoori swordfish.  update: i've been unfair to this restaurant. solid delivery, decent to good food. 3.5 stars.
qM9vU4XDuWyB3DWyxgZ4kA : I miss Boiler Market so much after graduating. What a fun place. First of all, it's perfect for college students. It's a market with anything you need, along with a full cafe/restaurant and tables to study at! They have a really nice menu for a sandwich/pizza place. Tons of options, Pizza, Pasta, Soups, Salads, Sandwiches... All of it is really good, too. Not only that, they serve beer! And the best deal on campus is a pitcher and a pie. It's great. $12 for a pitcher of any beer and a pizza. Can't imagine what is better than that, plus it's right on campus so convenient. I miss this place so much. Oh, and it delivers!
Fe9pl2Q4scRLp0AQIafKjQ : Thanks for the awesomely honest staff, quick service, and free/guilt free water.
MQm9cslep4hBENiZzVNk3w : Best pie in town, period!
X5jrUHW1RzPv7SuTBalprg : LOVE the frozen yogurt!! Best low-calorie dessert in town!
3WcntAro9UZaeMm_bdIneg : We were served sweet biscuits after we ordered two of the Fried Shrimp Po' Boys and sipped on our Red Stripes.    The Po' Boys were served a big roll with tasty  fries on the side (Good sized portions). I enjoyed both the sweet and peppery BBQ sauces on each of the tables.    I liked my experience at Rack & Soul, my only complaints are it's a bit pricey and it took over a week for my transaction to clear on my debit card... I don't know what was up with that.
h7oMiyVLWIIq3YBKqDIq2Q : Fran's is known mainly for their salt caramels, but all of their chocolates are good.  Whenever I visit the U Village, I make sure to stop in here and treat myself to a box. The service that they provide is topnotch, and the staff take great care to make sure that everything you get--the chocolates, the box they're in, the seal, the bow, the gift bag--is perfect.  And I always appreciate the sample of the day placed onto a little tray at the end.
P0wPUkqBD-iNAKtWZvUPxA : When I get my tax refund I'm going to eat here. This place is SOOO good. Unfortunately, you pretty much have to cough up $5 for bagels... ouch. Still, i can't seem to keep myself out of this place when I have a few extra dollars.
5up5QLJimkXWNurVuMWFIg : I really appreciate this place. It is important to know when to stay away though. And it is also important to remember that it is hit or miss like any other thrift-like store in the world.  The dollar a pound thing does skeeve me out so I stay away but a lot of folks dig it.  Halloween is hell there.....but they do offer some cool costume stuff....go early.....a month in advance!! Or if you can deal with the hell do it!  A couple of important things to note...(or at least things I liked:) You can have custom made t-shirts made on the first floor (very important when me and my friend start our bowling team:)  Also the shoe section often gets in great knock off shipments of cheap but decent looking shoes....along with some pretty scarily horrendous ones too.....  It is always an adventure indeed.
f-C9BPcAY8tPPf4mILEayw : The new location is a huge improvement for Mac's. What a difference a block or two can make. The old spot next door to the Cheetah looked pretty run down and the parking lot was always a little sketchy after the sun went down.  The level of service and staff haven't changed with the new spot, which is great since that was the best reason for heading to Mac's before the move. Mac's is a staple of the Ga. Tech student life with a great selection of booze.
LAzPUJTb4C1zJt1fdI3yNg : If none of the other reviews have convinced you to check out Follett's Intellectual Property, I have four words for you: Reader's Choice Book Club. While other bookstores make you pay a yearly fee to access their discount programs, Intellectual Property's is free and easy to join. You don't even have to give them your contact information, simply pick up a card and present it to the associate every time you buy a book. The associate will record your book price, and, after you've bought ten books, your purchases will be averaged and credited toward your eleventh book.  While Intellectual Property may not have an extensive selection, it does have a better specialty selection. Periodicals (especially literary journals) and regional works abound here.
nVbHf8HXftBo32aqA4iZBg : Cheap, quick, tasty, no-frills.  They lose a star because I've never frequented an Indian place where I find bones in my chicken curry as often as I do here.
EfBN4DdNP8NG4DL3YMwinA : This a good Italian place to eat. The food is delicious but the desserts are misleading!   For dinner, three of us got the chicken spinach cannelloni, king crab stuffed ravioli, and calamari fettucini----all great entrée's!   For dessert we got Tiramisu and Bavarian creme pastry with raspberry's as toppings---the desserts were not what we were expecting. The server brings by this tray with these delectable looking deserts, good looking enough to make my mouth water. We order the above items, and they were such a disappointment--not worth $8.00 each.   After this we got a wine flight, which is 4 different kinds of wine, house selected, as a taster. The wine was alright, once again, not too impressed.   The food is really good, everything else alright. I would definitely return, not a place I have ruled out of my book.
D2Iq_12vCG-xAatCZMBDcg : I've really grown to love this staple and its authentically, Japanese street-vendor food here in Collegetown, Ithaca. Whether you are in the mood for bubble tea, a decent bowl of ramen, or desserts that hit all the right buttons, Cafe Pacific have all your hunger-driven desires covered.   Seriously, I can't emphasize enough how many times the tiramisu here has saved me from moments of insanity when the semesters are getting rough. Not to mention the fact that they have azuki bean and green tea ice cream, in a bowl or waffle cone, at ridiculously cheap prices!  The staff members are generally very warm and friendly. This is especially true for Fumi-san, who adores the way I dress :P  So why 5 stars? Cafe Pacific's menu is ever expanding and has a great selection of desserts ranging from molten chocolate cake to tiramisu. The entrees are probably the most authentically Japanese in Collegetown, Ithaca, compared to Plum Tree and Miyake's. There is also something quite unique about the atmosphere, too. Like what other reviewers picked up on, it's hole-in-the-wall but with a touch of heart and comfort.
Y429-ZcM4izOdfx9TevKSQ : Really, I say it's 2.5 stars but it's seriously not as bad as people say it is so I'm giving it a 3.   The place has nice, comfortable seating...very big and I'd say it's pretty clean. Serious kudos for large party groups.   Anyway, I ordered their nengmyun (cold buck-wheat noodle soup) and I was surprised at how biggggggggg their portion size was! But when I looked at it, I was kinda disappointed with the amount of noodles they actually gave me...serving portion was not proportional with the bowl! :( They also only gave me 2 "slices" of beef which wasn't cut thinly like how beefs should be served in nengmyun...kinda like small slabs of 'em.   But overall, it really wasn't that bad. Yeah, of course I had better, but it wasn't so terrible that I'd never go back again.
GME91ReKlhHrCKLlsPBnuQ : I've been here twice now and I can honestly say, I'm a fan. The burgers are generously sized, juicy and delicious. The sweet potato fries are EXACTLY how others have described. At the food is in your face faster than you can say Bobby's Burger Palace. Truly, any place that can get your meal on the table that quickly deserves some serious probs. (unless it's name is mcdonalds in which case, who the hell cares).   The first time I walked in I was surprised that you ordered out of a queue, then got a number, then your food found you. But the second time, I was prepared for it all, and the results were simply fantastic. It's certainly not my idea of a place to go for a leisurely lunch. But you want to get your burger on, and you haven't got a lot of time (or if you are starving and must eat NOW). This place is going to make you happy on all counts.  You should try it. I did, and it's kind of changing my life :)
NnYMzVxx3shSJMbsQCPXxQ : My wife and in went here about six months ago. The fact that we have not been back since then probably implies something.  We had some pretty darn good onion rings for an appetizer. My wife had a Tomato Pesto Grilled Cheese sandwich that we thought was pretty good, along with a nice Tomato Bisque. I had a trio of Sliders: Asian, Tropical Stack, and Salmon, served with Sweet Potatoe Fries.  I grew up in an area that had White Castle restaurants. Now, I never went there unless pressed, but I do know what a slider is.  The problem with these was not the taste, which was fine. Nor the size, which was small. The problem is that sliders are moist / greasy. Now, I'm not saying that having a non-greasy slider is a bad thing from a healthful eating perspective. But if you're going to call something a slider, there has to be something non-dry about it. sigh.  Service was friendly.  I would like to get back there and try some other items, but we always seem to think of someplace else we'd rather eat.
XaWnpSpGoxxh23lagCW1TA : A festival of lights~!  As you've read with the other reviews - you will fall in love with the decor. Futuristic, Miami-esque, like a MAC Computer, Modern, etc etc. It is all of that.  I do think it is a little ill placed - I would much rather enjoy Pod if it was in Center City or Olde City but come to think of it..as I'm writing this I realize that if Pod was situated elsewhere - it might not pull off the same vibe b/c of its customers? Anyways, I love this restaurant.  It's fun, trendy (for Philly), & sassy.  The food is good, but the sea bass was way too watery & sweet. I haven't tried their sushi here - but I have tried their appetizers, entrees, drinks (stiff from what I recall) & dessert.  The dessert is why I made additional trips back - with dates, with family, any chance I could get.   I'm not sure if they still have it but if they do - order the 3 tier fondue dessert. Mini Cookies, cakes, chocolates, hello~!  So for kicks & yelp - I visited the restaurant's website to see if they still had this dessert - well I guess they call it Pod Sweet 18 now. Not sure how much they price it now but back in 2002-2004 - it was $12.  I didn't like their bathroom - the stalls are too small.  This place is good for groups of friends to hang out or to go on a date. Not so much for a family meal.
4JlRlETTSuH70eWEzgAlKg : Don't let the neighborhood discourage you from going there. This vietnamese bakery makes the softest and fresh cream cakes. You can order cakes for special occasions - birthdays, weddings, etc. I love this swiss roll made with 'pandan' leave flavor - it's a very delicate and sweet scent people from Southeast Asia use to cook rice or desert with. The cake is so moist yet delicate and filled with fresh cream. Sometimes I drive there just for that. Try it if you are in the area.
C9I32BgZ4ZCfa7Qws5dTgg : If you have some place to be within 2 hours, this is not the place to go.  My husband and I went there for lunch one day and it took over 1.5 hours to make our sandwiches!  The food was pretty good, but definitely NOT worth the wait.
rRnxMeTFLw_VdQZ_dRgPRw : i LOVE veggie heaven's food... the service may be... off.  one person may get their food before another, and the check is placed in front of you as soon as you're served.  as long as you can put that to the side, and enjoy the food then you're set.  the currybuns have always been my favourite.  lucky 7 is delicious.  the hawaiian luau and the hawaiian taro are both equally wonderful.  they have thai iced tea and bubble teas as well... it's all very filling and very cheap.
NyWbcy03zHkWyj1J_W0FHg : Was around UT and thought I would try the place out. The good was ok (but a sushi bar being out of Yellowtail?!?! I mean COME ON!) but the service was absolutely horrible. The Spicy Tuna Roll was quite good and had a great kick, but the tuna nigiri was not cold and looked scary (I was gonna say fishy, but I restrained myself).   There was NO excuse for service that bad though. Being one in the service industry, I tip well. That poor girl was doing good to get 10% out of me....it was THAT bad.
ODmgfY6Y2C-C-PXbeO6cug : This place gets four stars because it is vegan friendly.  A bit pricey, I admit, but try and go for the half-price menu, after 11 pm and if you are a student, sometime during the early afternoon (can't remember the times).  Happy hour is always crazy, with half off Margaritas and wings.  (Get the San Fran - yum!)  Take note - it's dark and NOISY, so don't go here for some intimate talk!
UxHMTtmLvLv6GnYb2PEHIg : We live in east county and wanted a different place to go for a treat near the coast for a little afternoon getaway. A friend suggested Sprinkles.  After waiting in line for about 30 minutes, we finally made it inside the door for another 7 minute wait to order. The place was outrageously noisy. When we were ordering, we were 2 feet away from the cashier, and I had to ask her to repeat what was said a few times. For as many people that fit in the small retail space, it was like being down front at a monster truck event. That's something that definitely needs addressing.  Now, as far as the cupcakes are concerned, the flavors that were available on a Saturday, were somewhat limited. But, we had 4 cupcakes @ $3.50 each! Ouch!! They were the same size you make at home, with, what other have mentioned, a heaping helping of really sweet frosting.  I sat outside at their cafe tables and ate my peanut butter and Belgian chocolate with chocolate frosting/sprinkles. Pretty tasty with little chunks of peanut butter & chocolate in the cake.  Oh, go on their website to find out what the word/phrase is to say when ordering to get a free cupcake with your paid order.     Parking is limited depending on how busy the shopping center is. Over all, the cupcakes were tasty, but not for $3.50 each and waiting almost 45 minutes. We still don't see what the big deal is/was(the wait in line). Well planned marketing I suppose.
gJFaB0X94ziyKtO8TVWSAA : I came here on a Tuesday night and was overwhelmed by the band! Brass Heaven, the regular tuesday nola jazz band was undeniably fantastic. Sadly there wasn't much of a crowd but I had a great time grooving with a smile on my face for a solid 2 hours. Bar's alright but the music was what made it for me!
aJI_j9PhIrhG8aca1FcOgA : For a bar with so many beers i was a bit disapointed that they only had a few on tap.    There is a lot of choice bit, for me, it lacked a bit of soul.  Also if you are going to call yourself an English bar you need to know what the difference is between English vs Brittish vs Irish.... just saying!
-pLBL_uht5AXPwfnDIvuCw : I don't think I've ever walked into this store and not purchased something. I sometimes wander in just because I want to see something pretty especially these days with all the rain. The stacks of seed bead vials are better than candy. I also really appreciate how organized everything is. You can look around and find everything without asking for help but when you need help it's available. And there really is something for everyone: beautiful semi-precious stones and vintage finds as well as horn and stone. And you can find those plastic earring back stops so you don't look your earrings. They don't even have those at CVS!
o8BrW0s6yLU0-Mt6XhN2CQ : For the person that complained about Kinsey always asking for Chuck, asking for Chuck is the best thing that can happen to you here. If you ever need anything that is legitimate always ask for Chuck. He actually cares about your concern. Yes, it may take a little more of your time but it is worth it.  Go to the office for maintenance that needs to be address promptly, don't do it online. 24 hour maintenance is not provided which is a downfall in real problematic situations but for the most part not a big deal. They will sometimes work after normal hours if they get the request within hours if it is for something serious even though they may not like it. When moving downtown things you have to know and be prepared for are not like many other places. You need to be ready for the cost of living here, renewing or pre-leasing your apartment and it being able to be shown. The rush when school starts is also a big deal. Be prepared, maybe double rent for the last week of the month because it is worth it and get your maintenance requested before the rush. Don't let yourself get lost in the crowd.  They will work with you. You just need to find the right people.
1OpkgxVDnt6wSaBfW0f-XA : The hot chocolate is so good!  It's super rich and tastes like basically a melted chocolate bar in a cup that's warm and covered in whipped cream.  It's a bit overpriced, I think one small cup of the hot chocolate is about 3.50 then if you want their homemade marshmallow it's like 50 cents extra or something.
0pD_ORmKQEUVjZ7vUMBSDw : True Story (a play in one act)  3:25 pm Karen: Tearing her hair out as the previous tenant did not give her the necessary tools to dismantle the king size bed so that she could move. Makes phone call to Dickson Brothers.  3:26 pm Steven = picks up and walks silly Karen through which hexagonal screwdriver size to use, promises to be around when she stops by.   (one panicked cab ride to Harvard square later)  3:45 pm Steven looks at all of the failed hexagonal screws and tries to find the perfect fit - gives Karen a set to try.  4:05 pm - (Back at the apartment) - Karen finds the perfect fit, dismantles the bed. Bed gets donated!  They are so helpful and so good to you and they really have everything you need. If I had stronger arms I would definitely leave with the whole inventory (especially the kitchenware!)
3nOvAKA0C8IcI3aYxheH8A : I am a Cal alum (shhhhhh....don't tell anyone), but one of my best friends has a husband who is a Stanford alum. Of course, on our way to visit him we would stop by the Rodin sculpture garden and enjoy the beautiful replicas of his great works. I have never been inside to the museum itself, but do appreciate the gorgeous outside area to walk and enjoy the art for free.  A great way to spend a nice sunny day...pack a picnic lunch and enjoy the day with a friend or a loved one.
NtJ9A2k-liddmgvsFJu9MQ : I was here early in the morning.  It was like McDonald's sponsoring a third world country in there.  It felt like a Starbucks trying to pull off.. well, just about ANY cause.  It felt like the Inferno.  Everyone was flying around and didn't want to make any relationships.  I didn't find our little corner to be particularly warm or cozy or conducive to conversation or ANYTHING.  Gut this place.  Put couches in here.  Some fucking megaphones.  And let her rip!  Free speech, man, what a bitch.  ON TOP OF THAT.  Don't fucking call THAT cappuccino.  Nop.  Sorry, dudes.  NOT A MOTHER FUCKING CAPPUCCINO.  Call me a snob.  Maybe I am.  But you gotto get THAT drink another name.  If it's not a fucking cappuccino, why call it that?  I pray.  Dear God, please give free speech another chance.    Maybe I'll go back for a sandwich, which I hear are good.    SIDENOTE:  A cafe serving this shit ass "cappuccino" should ALWAYS, I mean ALWAYS (and I hope the law would back me up on this one) have a bathroom within running distance available to it's customers.  If you're here before 9 when the library opens...  Wear Diapers, the moffitt bathroom here doesn't open until nine!  One star for bringing me closer to GOD.
ga2Wg5QJ0IR_diQEjLVPRg : Sweet Pop is absolutely amazing at satisfying my sweet tooth with wonderful sweets from custom cakes to cake pops to cookies and other desserts! So far I've ordered cake pops, specifically  Hello Kitty custom cakepops, a monkey cake for a birthday, and she made me a surf cake for mine! Check out the pics :) all of her work is high quality and adorable. The key is her cake is so moist and leftovers can last for a few days without drying out. I can't say enough good things and have referred her to several friends and coworkers who all rave about their desserts - I highly recommend!
5Wxt9tgBGlY3k0gsEYd1nA : Just a little update on Sprinkles...  The crowds seem to have subsided for the most part, though I do see the occasional line around the corner. Today I was in and out in 5 minutes, which was surprising/awesome for a weekend.  The cupcakes themselves generally range from a 3.5 to a 4.5 on any given day, depending on the flavor and on how fresh they are. My favorites so far:  - chocolate marshmallow (very chocolate-y, obviously, but the ganache is less overwhelming, in my opinion, than your standard buttercream or cream cheese frosting) - chai latte (the flavor of the frosting is to die for) - cinnamon sugar (no frosting but still one of my faves) - raspberry chocolate chip (the Valentine's cupcake that is in my personal cupcake hall-of-fame, and that I can't wait to eat again next year)  Cute little tidbit: Royal wedding cupcakes were sold on Friday. Haha.
q4dQH3__n3Z3YWyFge_ukA : Besides warm weather there are a few things that I look forward to summer in this area.  Begining with Moxies!!!  This is the best ice cream place I have ever been.  The ice cream is not only great but when you mix some of the different strange flavors they come up with you can really hit all your taste buds.   Beyond the great tastes you find at Moxies there is also a great environment for taking the family out.  With places to sit, things for the kids to play on and great ice cream there is no place better to spend some time with family!!!
Hz2Y9U7zpxWbplrLzkhulg : It was the first time I had mediterranean food and it was a positive experience. The service is good, they were able to serve my crew team who came in for brunch. The atmosphere is also very hip but inviting.
rpg8fKu5cdfCoRDAi5bY6Q : I have a pet peeve for misspelling of words, especially when it's done just to be cute.  Anyway. :D  Kathy's Candies tends towards the lower end of the chocolate spectrum - think Whitman's instead of Godiva or See's or Vosges.  It's good for what it is - and it's definitely made on-premises by Kathy and her assistants. It's just not "zomg super awesome" chocolate.  Some people LOVE this kind of candy though, and so this is their place.  There was a time though when my wife and I would go in every single night and each get a chocolate mousse.  She even told us her recipe; it was a very simple recipe.  Of course, then we went and worked out how many calories a serving was... and we don't get it anymore. ;)  I've never tried any of their drinks or anything other than their handmade chocolates.  The aforementioned chocolates are good, in the genre they are.   They've lasted a surprisingly long time on seemingly cursed Main St Lafayette, so they must be doing something right. Not my favorite chocolate shop but definitely not bad either.
y-KJlvTUidoqpgee_bM1ZA : My friend and I are visiting from Rhode Island and I have never tasted a more delicious cup cake in my life! I got the vanilla buttercream cupcake and it was absolutely amazing. We met the owner, who is an extremely sweet guy as well. The place is really cute and modern inside and feels very comfortable. I would definitely recommend this place if you're looking to cure your sweet tooth!
rxSV4Rbxxnjj95s4PDIkkg : Meh. Haven't eaten here too often, but the food is just average. Not exciting enough for me to ever want to come here. The only fun part about this place is they actually have nice places to sit and a functional bathroom (quite rare in this college town).
n8_xmgeIPySiIaQ-JFuLBw : Doesn't beat Pacific East Mall's J & S Coffee & Tea House, but still great. I LOVE LOVE LOVE their Banana Lover smoothie (WITH PEARL). It is great.  One thing I don't like, cash only. But it is Asian Ghetto, so it's understandable. But still, I have a card, I NEVER have cash, so yeah.  Also, one of the people at the registers (a girl) has an obnoxiously rude attitude that most Cantonese women have when they're aggravated, but there's this thing called CUSTOMER SERVICE and it's what keeps me and other people coming back.  A-OK, but needs customer service training.  Oh, and the burgers are excellent.
fkgC9MZqxl9oWe4cXmRsCg : THANK YOU, is all I have to say to the folks of Otto for transplanting the amazing establishment from Portland, ME to Cambridge.  Many a time I have visited my friends in Portland and enjoyed Otto's pizza, and with each crunchy cheesy bit I wished we had something like it in the Cambridge area.  This place has definitely dethroned Upper Crust in my eyes.  They have funky slices like cranberry, butternut squash, ricotta (my fav) and pulled pork mango to test your taste buds, as well as the classics.  The crust is super crunchy, which I love, and the pizza is never too anything (saucy, cheesy, or under/over cooked).  The staff is also very friendly.  Three cheers for Otto!
bpNna6F9t2csYZy-2Y4h_g : how could i refrain from reviewing the hole-in-the-wall that got me through many-a finals-crunch time? chanos is cheap, and damn good.  their nachos are yum (although i have to admit...panchos in the university village just down 30th street has nachos that blows chanos out of the water), their chile relleno burrito is hands down the best i've ever had.  and their horchata is solid.  i feel sorry for people who didn't attend usc for the sole reason that they were denied the privilege of always having this great mexican place in the dining mix!
c3d1qgm3oBl8WbkbxkPqig : A coworker brought us Stan's doughnuts for breakfast the other morning, I don't know how okay with myself I feel after partaking in this but man, they were delicious.  We got a variety and actually cut the donuts into quarters to share because they are just that darn big.  We tried PB&J, PB&Banana and PB&Chocolate all of which are hefty doughnuts in the style of a cream filled donuts except instead of cream they have one of the before mentioned mixes inside. He also got an apple fritter because those are my favorites.    Everything was exceptionally delicious and overly sugar and a bit greasy.  Will I eat here again?  Yes!  Will I remain fat for the rest of my life? Probably.
MjU9CII6vjfM2pbwbVVV7w : All the beers are great. I especially like The Original Chai, it's like Autumn in a glass. Staff was friendly and very knowledgable!
I4qNUNcUhs5W2a2M8GPyuQ : I agree with Cari H, easy on the harsh words as they get going.   The real news here is: THE HAVE MORE THAN JUST SAM ADAMS! Went in on a Thursday night and the place was packed, but grabbed a seat at the bar within five minutes. The bar is awesome, beautifully laid out. Yes, there are some folks that work there that are still learning how to navigate the incredibly large tap structure in the middle, but our service was fine (minus one woman). Food was good, beer was delicious. Owner was friendly and chatty.  I will say, there was one waitress who was a a bit nasty, when we asked if we could order food her response was "i don't know what time is it?" and then never talked to us again.Luckily, there a few other attentive folks that helped us get a burger and served us more beer.  I also watched the same chick who did not want to serve food, serve a very pricey cognac in someone's used check glass. She was out of glasses so grabbed one that had been sitting on the bar with someone's bill in it and emptied out the paper and poured the drink. The guy getting served said, "is that dirty?" and she said "no it just had a check in it". Sorry but no one wants a 20 drink in a used glass, even if it was just a check. That guy responded simply with no tip.   I give the place four stars, because we love beer and need more selection and food was good. I am not going to let one incompetent waitress cloud my whole experience, although if i were managing that place I would weed her out pretty quickly.
0y_BxZTiD0E-rmae3LUmew : Recently I flew into LAX for an interview and hailed a taxi for the ride to the office.  To the driver's credit, he realized it was close.  However, his way of telling me that I'd be better off walking than spending $17.50 to go four blocks was really bad.    Taxi driver - "There is a minimum charge of $15.00 from LAX plus a $2.50 surcharge.   It's posted on the window."  Me - Looking ahead and not seeing anything.  "Where is it posted?"   Taxi driver - "On the window!"    Me - still not seeing it.  The driver pulls the flag and begins driving.  Taxi driver - "Over there, on the door."   Me - "OK, now I see it and now it's too late.  Quite the racket you guys have."  I am fuming at this point.  $15 minimum and a $2.50 surcharge to boot.  If you don't have luggage, walk a couple of blocks to the nearby Radisson hotel and flag a cab there.  LADOT and the taxi companies are out to gouge you!
EN4emtIEraE-j2mRbN4fcQ : I went here this past weekend with Kailee P.  She pretty much summed up our experience.  I like the decor and the waiters were nice (one was training...first day on the job).    We were there for about an hour and a half.  I honestly think they forgot our order.  What bugs me is that, if you did, just admit it, instead of continuously saying "it'll be out in a minute."  The food wasn't hot at all.  The sweet potato pancakes were quite mushy.  The fish and grits were good, but again, the food was cold.
4S3j8Z0p9WtCmt0Hp5VROg : On the way out of town we stopped in, drawn by the good reviews and the promise of an exotic bayou breakfast.     Always torn between sweet and savory, while on vacation I had both, a fine tender pain perdu with two thick patties of blackened sausage and a side of hash browns.   The latter soaked up one of the dozen varieties of hot sauce set on each table (we found the house brand the best balance of flavor and lack of chemicals) while the former came laden with pecans and the house-made honey rum and spice "syrup" which  was thicker and sweeter than maple, but when contrasting against the pepper sauce it sure hit the spot.     For all the extras, including a standout french roast, breakfast rang in at under $15 a head.
g9HcYdnoUlrdlKVuKlSjXA : this place is quicker than a hiccup.  they had my food ready before i could even whip out my cash.  this place is quick, good and decently priced.  my personal favorite is the beef kabob plate.  the meat is soft and has some nice flavor seasonings.    my only complaint about this restaurant is that the lines can get pretty long but given how fast their service is, you wont be waiting too long.
sLsh9PO2CTzVUgRu_gUt-w : Quick, tasty and affordable. I've been a patron of East Side Pockets for about a decade.  Personal favorites include the spinach pie with just the right amount of hummus and tzatziki sauce, falafel wrap and of course the Gyro.  Don't skip dessert! There is a small glass case by the register loaded with authentic Baklava and more.  Seating is limited and the lighting is a little bright inside for my taste. In the summer, I recommend finding a good place to sit outdoors.
61z5aiHStlZu-l-UZ61PmQ : I don't really like donuts, but every once in awhile I'll have one just to see if perhaps my tastes have evolved.  When I walked into the conference room of the Palomar one morning, I was surprised to see a box full of beautiful and creatively decorated donuts in front of me.  They looked so good I decided to try half of one while I sipped on my coffee. I sliced in half the red velvet donut topped with icing and with one bite my body almost melted. The donut was so moist, velvety and cake-like that it tasted like a decadent dessert rather than a typical donut.  A few hours later I also sliced off a little piece of a cookies and cream  donut and that too was phenom.   Seriously, probably some of the best donuts I have ever had.
-njeoQ1WTtOpnfrBr2g0NQ : If you love music, movies, and/or good deals (basically if you're alive) then you'll probably like Rasputin.   I love all of the above. I LOVE Rasputin. I've been going to this location for over 10 years now (wow that makes me feel old). I used to go CD shopping here all the time. They have great deals on new and used CDs. And they have ALL TYPES of music. Seriously. If you can imagine a genre they will most likely have it. The store has three huge floors and they are all chalk full of CDs.   They even have a great selection of vinyl records. I would get some for my dad who still has his old turn table. Id also get them for my friends as decoration. Just find a band you know they like and buy them a record and they'll love it. It looks great on a wall.   After iTunes came along and kinda killed CDs I'd still buy some here. But my trips to Rasputin mainly were to buy DVDs. I love movies and love to buy them for cheap. I prefer actual DVDs to digital copies. So I'd always buy so many movies from this place at amazing prices. Every time I left the store with at least two DVDs of some great movies. And I definitely had a huge smile on my face.   The staff is also really nice and very helpful. If you need something or have a question they either know the answer or will find out for you.   This is a place that you have to check out.
M0TJGZWLaq7E7mAFN44ToQ : A very affordable self service yogurt shop...  They dont have too many flavor selections, but they sure do have lots of toppings!  And the price is right too!  Somewhere around 28 cents a ounce i think!  Compared to the fricken 38 cents an ounce i have to pay down here in orange county!!!   I tried to get a job here once, but I guess they don't hire asians lol!  No love loss though!
fkfRjMC9Ah48UA8njPQU9w : I recently saw a play at the Actor's Express. The play was good, but this review is about the venue. Actor's Express is located in the King Plow Arts Center, a little arty complex which was converted from buildings of the old King Plow Co. factory. The center houses a variety of tenants including Actor's Express. While there for the show, I didn't get much of an opportunity to walk around, but the space is pretty unique and funky looking.  The theater itself only holds about 100 people creating an intimate theater experience. The theater company of the same name puts on a variety of shows every year from broadway hits to world premiere productions. I hope to return for another show and also to check out more of the center.
ZUHRIM_Youhh1sShOl0WXQ : i was first turned on the the goorin brothers in an article in a GQ style guide. as my boyfriend and i were walking down the ave on a mission for some lunch, i spotted it. THERE IT IS!! awwwwwwww snap.   the bf is huge into hats. wears them extremely well. naturally, we stepped in. we were promptly greeted by two guys, but after we told them we weren't necessarily looking for anything in particular, they went back to their conversation.   fair enough.   i really like the decor of the shop. i love the hats. however, i needed to keep in mind that you get what you pay for here, and it turned out to be more of a window shopping experience.   we kinda laughed, though, when we noticed that two college-aged girls came in and this time the guys moved over toward the door and provided a little more... "guest service." hey... it is what it is.   we'll be back! ...or at least we'll be shopping online under "sale."
WQiLJIDXGUQDM03srUAbvQ : Steve, Steve, your skin is dark much more than any Kim or Park But it's OK if your cooks aren't Asian because on the outside I'm Korean, but inside Caucasian  OK, here's the deal, the kimchee is lacking, and the sprouts are "eh", but the meat over rice is tasty and they give you a lot!  My favorite is the Spicy Pork (#2), had the regular beef (#1) but found it lacking taste.  This place is one of those places where they may not be good at a lot of things, but the one or two things they have are solid.    PS: they give you extra spicy sauce (koju jang...I'm sort of Korean OK!) and so mix that in and you got yourself a winner whether it's meat plate #1 or #2 :)
rLXf454IRQUQslz-EMGL9Q : This little tiny shop was overflowing with people.  The two scoop cup was humongous. I got oreo and coconut, both were delicious. The oreo ice cream had tons of cookies. The coconut ice cream had tasty coconut chunks.
U9BtklmHwYpe8TptRn7GjQ : From the second you walk in to Mr. Bartley's to the second you leave, you are entangled in a mix of strange posters, mammoth burgers, and awful onion rings. Yup. You heard me right. I don't like Bartley's "World Famous" onion rings. I'll get to that later.  Burgers:  Each of Bartley's burgers are a mound of fresh ground beef. Seared to perfection on a fluffy white bun, each one is unique. With names like the "Steve Jobs" and the "Barack Obama", it's hard to judge this book by it's cover.   When I got my burger, it was pink and undercooked. Note to consumer: order your burger "medium well" if you want it cooked with a smidge of pink in the middle. I kindly asked the waiter if it could be sent back to the grill. Her response: "Oh sure, I'll send it back. No problem." No problem with the service. The waitress couldn't have been nicer.  Everything else:  The onion rings are awful. Simple as that. They have NO flavor, no crunch, and there soggy as well. The fries are good, but not great. Root beer! The root beer was great. Free refills. [holla!]  Would I go back? Yes. With the ambiance, the burgers, the drinks, and the staff, Mr. Bartley's Burger Cottage is nothing to sneeze at.
TfIHigj_0fb0lFZGLZS_jA : I can't believe why would anyone give this place a 3 star or less for reasons beside the DMV-magnitude line at certain times of the day (mainly the whole time it opens except for around 3 or 4pm)?  Mrs. Fields-grade cookies at such low prices that would surely have Mrs. Fields pack her bags and go back to Utah (and I think she did...or at least the company filed for chapter 11).  You can always find moist and melt-in-your-mouth cookies here (unless you opt for the one-day old ones that aren't half bad with an even cheaper price tag).  With about ten different kinds of cookies and twelve different ice cream flavors, the options for a cookie ice cream sandwich are only limited by your imagination (and ability to count the number of combinations...let's see... 10 * 12 * 10 = 1200 possible combinations!)  I usually don't go for the ice cream sandwich because that would just ask for a diabetic attack.  Regular dozen is good enough for me.  I had to control myself the first time I saw the price here for a dozen....$3.75!!! With that many cookies, Mrs. Fields would have you put a lien on your house.  Like I said..this place has all your cookie needs at a steal.  Don't worry about the long line...it goes by really fast.
yXl-BracW-8JKy3pX_fzfA : Didn't realize that Baker's happy hour goes until 9PM!  They have a lot of drink specials and honestly, I can't repeat it on here because its just THAT many.    The food there is decent... and what you MUST try is their tacos (I know... at an English bar... you prolly think I'm nuts to suggest that, but seriously try it!).    I love the patio here.  Its pretty chilled and spacious.  They also have heat lamps for cold nights and it feels great (when it working).  Generally, the crowd is a mix between the older crowd and college kids.  You'll see men in suits coming in to avoid the rush hour traffic as well.  Over the weekend, there's a bouncer at the front and back door checking IDs, but during the work week, I don't see them out as much.    Again, its a pretty chilled bar and smaller than Sherlock's (which is Baker's sister bar).
0PH5B-UxsNxuNA1gt0nMDg : Sure it's a dump and you may see some things that probably will scare you off if you're the health inspector  Best damn tacos though  haven't gotten sick from Chano's yet!   :)
m1XMydU9ZCTEfEsdwEgBjw : I just came back from eating dinner at Stix, and it was my second time going.  I remember it being decently good the first time, but that could have been because I didn't pay for it.  Free food always tastes better.  =)  Second time around, however, was not so great.  Actually, I ordered the Spinach Salad and that was pretty good.  The skewers of beef and salmon I had on top, not so great.  The beef is too bland for my taste.  There's no marinade on it.  The salmon is so-so.  I think the biggest turn off is the price.  At almost $10 without a drink, no thanks.  I probably won't be coming back.
qpxk7ZPA3UdrngfqtPlQYQ : Beautiful campus and facilities!  We attended the Banff Mountain Film Festival here over the weekend.   Great venue and vibe.
NWmqbEe7daBTO5VrGVENXw : I walk in for breakfast specials "starting at $2!", alright, so I expected that one french toast, one pancake or two pieces of average toast would be that minimum. What I don't appreciate is being told, after attempting to order, that these specials are only available with a purchase of a drink. It mentions on their menu that this is the case, but only on the separate page for lunch specials. If this is the case for both separate pages, print it on both pages or print the menus on the same page.  No, I don't want a drink, I just came down here from Sureshot because their wireless is broken and you supposedly have cheap breakfasts, alright? So I order my two eggs over medium (or hard, whichever your cook/s can do-- they also come with no toast or hash browns like the specials states they do) and fruit cup, without being told the price of each item, only my total of $6.87.  That's absurd. For less than $2 of food, 3/4 of which is hardly even touched before serving.  I get my fruit cup, I notice, oh awesome, a decent amount of this is banana. I'm allergic to banana, but that's my fault for not mentioning. How are my eggs? Barely sunny-side up. That's -gross-. I appreciate your service at the counter as a meek attempt to make up for your failings, but this is just bad.  You're not worth the time. I'd rather go to Starbucks.
by9PjLXFlvCkNC1RqKSRdQ : Best tacos and tamales in town, also, the best price. I absolutely love the place, the food is so good,and the owner is about the nicest guy ever.  If you want ripe avocados, do not waste your time at any other grocery store. It looks like everyone else has said it better, so I will just state that; I concur, and thank heavens for El Charro.
aAE4x_qXquOH4CkRJ7YU2Q : Maybe it was when I went. I went around 10:30, so I guess it had just opened even though there were other people eating in there. Both of my selections, mango and pomegranate, came out slushy and melted.  Also the mochi was nearly empty and they were all stuck together leading me to believe they were just trying to get ride of yesterday's leftovers. I have had mochi in my frozen yogurt many times and it has never been that texture. I'd also like to point out that the worker had his 4 or 5 year old son bringing out more toppings as I was paying for my yogurt. Although I thought this was cute at first, it's actually pretty wrong if you think about it.   I don't see what the big deal is about this place at all. I have been to at least 10 frozen yogurt places that are on par or better. Yes, it's on campus but is there anything else going for it?
_ssljH_iIFl3lTdoWEfsMA : Drove up specially from Sunnyvale just to try out Kara's, got the lemon cupcake, wasn't a fan of the frosting, but the cake was nice.  I do have to say however that the employee that helped me left much to be desired. I was one of only two people in the shop and she treated me as thought I was inconveniencing her. Not good.  Tonite I am going to head back up but this time I will stand in line at Sprinkles and see how they compare.
BiRyCRW20Sg_-AngAuIWWw : I like The Hole in the Wall.  I've only been a few times, but it's fun.  First of all, it's really big.  There is a front room, which generally has a chill, fun band playing.  And there's a large back room which seats a bunch and has another stage for a band (and another bar).  Then there's outdoor seating as well, so they can literally pack them in.  And there's no cover, at least when I've been.  The beer is cheap, I believe they have Guinness on tap, and I like it here.  If it was closer, and I was younger, I'd go a lot more than I do.
_qmDyFJk1joJHuUbV8aM7A : On Cornell's campus, or perhaps anywhere in Ithaca, Manndible Cafe is definitely as good as it gets for local, sustainable, vegetarian-friendly food that is totally delicious and affordable.  Breakfast: they serve Ithaca Bakery/CTB bagels and bagel egg sandwiches, granola, tofu scramble wraps and toasts, yogurt. The tofu scramble wrap... hot damn! So good you'd never think it was tofu. Not that there's anything wrong with tofu.  Beverages: they offer Gimme! Coffee and espresso drinks, Ithaca Chai, real smoothies (no creepy cartons of flavored liquid), a number of teas, juices, spritzers, and the like.  Other delicious foods: they offer a wide variety of ready-to-eat refrigerated foods like mac and cheese, Asian noodles, sushi, spanakopita, and they also have a burrito bar and two soups every day, one vegetarian and one for omnivores. The soups are goooood - made nearby in Ithaca, You can even call a number to find out what their soups are every day. Their burrito fillings are locally sourced meats and vegetables. I love the beef in particular, a combination of pulled and ground meat.  Treeeeats: They also have a lot of snacks in little ziplocs (chocolate covered espresso beans - holy CRAP) and insanely good baked goods from local bakeries (tea bread, scones, etc).   Other perks: They also have cards that you can put cash on and get a discount with (i.e. buy a $50 card for $45, and so on in increasing increments), and buy 9 drinks and get 1 free! The employees are super hip and friendly, and the customers range from sorority girls to CALS professors to the crunchier side of Cornell. Pretty great for people watching as well as food, and you can feel good about buying local without participating in Cornell's dining racket. Clearly, I could go on forever. You can find me there a few days a week drinking Ithaca Chai and eating banana tea bread or rubbing a beef burrito all over my face.
zAK1qV7QV2e-IyVJ6hmRug : Yes.  Yes.  Oh. My. God.  Oh. Yes.  Uh huh.  Uhh huh.  Yes.  Thank you.  _____  I had the PLEASURE of trying the most delicious little piece of heaven yesterday, and it was in the form of a cupcake.  Yes, a little cupcake.  I cannot explain just how good this creation was.  I snagged a cupcake yesterday around 4pm, they were leftovers from a meeting.  I normally don't really care about free afternoon snacks.  I'm not really a cupcake kinda gal, but this one made me shut my mouth and lean up against the filing cabinets in the conference room and say out loud "this is the best thing I've ever had."  The three other ladies I was with all agreed.  It may or may not have sounded like a 2 minute porn to anyone who walked by that conference room.  I got the Madagascar Vanilla Bean with chocolate frosting.   I might have to start treating myself to Sweet on a weekly basis.  The cupcake was the perfect size, probably 2 bites.  They have regular sized ones too, but I like the mini ones.  Sweet just opened a lovely little storefront on Zero Brattle in the middle of Harvard Square.  During lunch today, I decided to walk the 50 steps from office to Sweet.  It's an adorable little store.  Stop reading this review and just go.    You'll thank me later!
jG1nElIGSWt8pIhNccHAlQ : I was cranky. It had been too long since I had something in my mouth. I longed for something to fill my void. I couldn't take it anymore. I needed something to fulfill my needs and what better than a big, fat, juicy sausage?!   Maybe it was the fact I was a bit hungover, or maybe it was the fact I hadn't eaten all day, but DAMN that was some good food. We sat in the front by the fireplace and watched the football game, and despite the fact the Seahawks got owned by the Packers we enjoyed our meal. Really enjoyed it. The food was fatty and a bit greasy, but oh-so-delicious. I usually hate shoestring french fries, but these were perfectly seasoned - salty, but not too salty. I highly recommend the cheesesteaks and of course, the sausages. The sausages are huge and come in between some really soft buns. Ahem!  Not only do they have hearty, greasy baskets o' yummy food at reasonable prices - they also have lots of reasonably priced alcohol. I noticed on their drink list that they have DAILY drink specials (yes, daily, not just for a few hours) and the drink specials were cheap - right around $3 to $4. They offer lots of great imported beers from Germany, Belgium and England as well as some local microbrews.   I felt comfortable and cozy in this place. The service staff was friendly and very attentive. Even though there was a football game going on, the customers weren't rowdy or obnoxious. The open kitchen adds to the ambiance without making it feel pretentious. I would consider this place more of a restaurant than a bar and in fact, they actually close at midnight - so I think they consider themselves that too.   All in all, this is a great, cozy place to get drunk and shove sausages in your mouth. My only gripe is that this place is in the U-District. I hate going there and trying to find parking! But, I will be back. Good sausage always keeps me coming back.
zMkUlNIcQGds4cSZWTgs4A : The new Ike's place at Stanford campus was a HUGE disappointment. I love Ike's Place in San Francisco and Redwood Shores, but this one is definitely not worth going to for me. Here's how I break it down:  Pros - Plenty of seating. It's in some sort of student center so there are plenty of tables and chairs to enjoy your meal. This is the only plus, relative to the other locations.  Cons -   - Hard to find. I had the address in Google maps on my phone, yet it took me at least 20 minutes of walking around campus to find this place. There are no signs making it clear, even when you're 20 feet away from it.  - Paid parking. I had to pay for parking!  - No fresh baked bread. At this location I ordered and my sandwich was ready 5 minutes later. Some may see faster service as a pro, but I used to love the fact that Ike's Place baked their bread to order, explaining the 20 minute wait for sandwiches. I don't know why they're sacrificing one of the biggest factors that made their food unique at this new location.  - Small and expensive. The guy at the counter explained that they offer half-sized sandwiches at this location and that their prices are cheaper than the SF location. Unfortunately this means that they sell half-sized sandwiches for the same price of a full sandwich at Redwood Shores. I spent $17 on two tiny sandwiches, and both me and my brother were still hungry after finishing the meal (we even had free chips because of a coupon from their mailing list). Definitely not worth the price.  - Temporary cons: no credit card, no telephone for phone orders, and limited selection of sandwiches. They claim they will fix this when business starts to increase.  Overall, this location is not worth going to. It's deep in campus so it takes forever to get to, paid parking, small sandwiches and NO FRESH BAKED BREAD (the worst, in my opinion). It may be worth it for Stanford students if they want an expensive sandwich, but everyone else should make the drive to Redwood Shores for a real meal.
6N6E7rN03QOJ_HNAnK6oFg : Pros - Stiff Drinks  Cons - Hella loud and some questionable people
GlzTdZoOlAsSka3b-2LdQQ : Over the past few years Diddy Riese has been making some tweaks to their menu. Of course they have maintained their staples of cookies and ice cream, but they have recently added ice cream sundaes and Hawaiian shaved ice. They have also gotten rid of hot dogs, which they had for many years. Although the hot dogs were cheap, like everything else on their menu, I could never bring myself to try one. It just didn't seem right that a cookie shop would be serving hot dogs. However, with Diddy's new menu items, they have returned to what they do best. Sweet treats!   The Hawaiian shaved ice has been on the Diddy Riese menu for a little while now, and I finally tried it this past week. I went with one of the recommend flavor mix choices that they had on their menu board. It was a cherry pina colada type concoction served on top of a scoop of vanilla ice cream. It was excellent! The sweet syrup flowed through the ice and infiltrated the flavor of the ice cream in sugary goodness. Now I'm not going to tell you how Diddy Riese has some scientific, revolutionary process in how they shave their ice in order to achieve amazing texture, because they don't. What I will say is that for a $1.50 this is a great treat, and I am looking forward to having it again...and again   I am also looking forward to trying a Diddy Riese ice cream sundae soon. It is the newest addition to the menu, and I will have to choose between a sundae or one of their other sweets the next time that I go.  It will be a hard choice, but I am already thinking about what I will choose.
Hm8v_3n55wiaOHRqfdoIcw : I always complain about the wildly excessive prices when we go here, but the truth is Main Street has my favorite salads in town and often has interesting seasonal menus.  The service is always pleasant and prompt.  Beware- the kitchen closes early!  On the whole, Main Street is one of our stand-by places to go.
AB99qSGKCzGrg3xlBFb8KA : Best beer on the planet.  Yes, their St. Maeve's Stout is the best black  or brown beer I have ever tasted.  I lived in Germany for 3 years, and have been all over Ireland and England and the U.S., and I think I've tried every dark beer commercially available.  St. Maeves has the perfect combination of roasted, chocolate, and bitter flavors.  By which I mean it is neither sweet nor bitter - just perfect.  The only reason I limited it to 4 stars was the food wasnt all that great.  I had the pulled pork which was okay.  Others had steaks, burgers, and ribs - all good but not great.  Their smoked baked beans are great though!  The root beer was flat and too sweet.  Great service by the bar area staff even though the place was jam packed.
KzYa5VEFEDHPFq69-h8Kkw : Some of the best thai food ever. Also some of the blandest. this place has been very hit and miss for me, but it also has been the best thai i've ever had.
p9plysLUiilytn8yGpe0rw : My bf took me here because he knows I love Mexican food, and this is by far one of the greatest restaurants I've ever been to, if it's not my absolute favorite! Ordered the blackened chicken fajitas.. Incredible, best tasting chicken I've ever had! And our waiter was so great we left him a 50% tip! Also very inexpensive for the quantity and quality! We had leftovers for dinner tonight! We'll be back next week!! :)))  -Also, the steaming hot homemade chips with salsa are deliciouss!
fOu2t9uveF0ouVD4MugTIw : India Garden is a great go-to for lunch buffet or late-night food.  The selection is wide, the food is delicious, and the price is nice (but much better during the half off periods.)  The service is pretty mediocre at best, but to be honest I didn't expect much.  They're slow, generally unfriendly, and my water goes unfilled a lot. It wasn't always that way, but oh well.  The atmosphere is pretty enjoyable, in my opinion.  I like having late night food and drinks while Bollywood music videos blare in the background.  It makes for a loud restaurant, but when you're partying late at night, you're not looking for a quiet place.  Overall, this is a good place for Indian food.  The selection is great, with tons of things on the menu (almost 100 or more I think).  It's definitely not the best Indian food in the Burgh, but the portions and prices let you share a bunch of dishes around, resulting in what I'd consider a true Indian dining experience.  I'd recommend late night after 10, when the food goes half-price.
6FsIJN2qX6_VGwVDZcWuqw : I really like this place. I used to take friends here often and I've ordered delivery several times.  The service is good and the sushi is fresh. This is probably my favorite sushi place in town, though Sushi O Sake is a very close second.
7or0i4dFs-K04WDSyEA4iw : Viva oh Viva. This place is FAB!  I love every part of it.  The food, ambiance, service, etc!  I'm a huge Tapas lover.  From LA to OC to San Bernadino to Vegas-I've been to many.  If you want authentic tapas and to eat in a place that makes you feel like you're actually in Spain this is the place to be.   Whether a nice dinner with your significant other or a girls night out, this place is suitable for both!  A place you can spend hours at just chit chatting, sharing glasses of sangrias and tapas dishes.  Dishes to try: Paella Canaria (saffron rice, spicy sausage, pork, chicken &amp; chorizo) Esparragos Blancos Con Salmon (white asparagus with smoked salmon) Emanada De Pollo (Chicken, onions, red bell peppers & parsley) Patatas Bravas (fried potatoes with brava tomato sauce & parsley)  Drinks:  Sangria is a must!  One of the best prices for tapas.  Highly highly highly recommended! Even thinking of my next bday there with my girls.
KbnjCcxEAXlMTbgqusQV6w : I have to second everything that Joyce K. eloquently said below. This place is totally undiscovered. The food was EXCELLENT and the service was fine. Parking is free and easy as Kendall Square can be quiet dead on the weekend. There was maybe one other couple in the restaurant besides us.  I recommend either the filet mignon or the rib eye steak. The quality and flavors surpassed my expectations for such good value.   I will return to this restaurant for sure - most likely on some random night when the parking and crowds in Inman or Central get to me. (-:
Uknk84Po0HIWLFnTqAblxw : Sister restaurnat to Fontaine's in the Highlands, the Steamhouse has been a Buckhead Village staple for years.  The simple menu of steamed seafood and a smattering of sandwiches is consistant and reliable.  The tiny restaurant gets quite crowded, especially when th eweather breaks.  They opened an additional dining room next door for the overflow.  The lobster bisque is a real crowd pleaser.  The resataurnat does not have a fryer, so no fried seafood or fries and the like.
V2S5ZhaHllmqhJDR_-yhnw : OK, well I got off to a shaky start in this place, but my husband swore the pizza rocked! I'm not sure if it was the red and blue tape lines on the floor to indicate where to go, or the gaudy mish mash of colored ugly signs everywhere, but esthetically it wasn't pleasing. I couldn't get beyond the cold, unwelcoming ambiance; just didn't feel like where pizzas should come from. However, I have to admit my husbands pizza crust looked REALLY tasty...that brick oven flakiness. If you are looking for a quick bite, and are willing to walk with it...Blondies might work for you. There are a few random tables and stools facing the wall to sit on. I bet this place is busy during school...within a block of U.C. Berkeley.
P3zQli-bu0ckqYaqk_5-kw : **Bursting the Bagel Bubble**  There once was a girl who only purchased her bagels from Einstein Bro.  This habit lasted 7 years, 4 in Arizona, and 3 here in Texas during Law School.  She enjoyed the bagels and the generous helping of shmears.  It was her weekly tradition to stop by and pick up a blueberry or sesame seed bagel w/ light cream cheese.  For 7 years, she skipped merrily along her way, satisfied with the average bagels.  Then, she experienced bagels from another location in Austin (one she has written a previous review of) and realized, that she had been missing out.  But, to give Einsteins a fair chance, she skipped over and purchased her usual sesame seed and light plain cream cheese bagel.  BURST went her bagel bubble...  The Einstein Bro. bagel was heavy, doughy, and fairly bland.  The outer part was slightly tough.  The shmear, while still generous in portion size, was average, but nothing for her to sing about.  Overall, it was a mediocre bagel and experience.  So the girl had finally had her bagel bubble burst -- the bagels she once enjoyed, no longer lived up to her expecations, for she had tasted other, better bagels, for the same if not cheaper price.    And with these new realizations, the girl's relationship with Einstein Bro. was over.  The End.
DP1FHBX7_ciHSJCrEW3xTQ : Great basics, trendy jeans, spastic t-shirts, "distressed" hobo blazers, some stupid crap.  Check the sale rack.  Wonderful belts.  I love the belts here.    Look, just because you've never had the urge to start a myspace page, that doesn't mean you're not allowed to shop here.  Anyone who says otherwise can buy a one-way ticket to my fist.  Trendy?  Sure.  Yesterday's de rigueur stripped shirts have turned into today's emo Sherlock Holmes vests.    Coming in 2008: fluffy white pirate shirts and eye patches.  "They're not jeans.  They're pantaloons, motherfucker."
3UHkK6QzuuV4FLoOOAPTPw : I love the bubble tea herrreee! It's delicious..and I like having the choice of all the different drinks they have with the silly descriptions. I haven't been disappointed yet. I will say to all of those that described momokos as being cluttered..that they've done away with a lot of that stuff so now it's more minimalist. I hate the tiny parking lot but the taste! The taste is worth having to walk a few blocks to have some.  Everything is cute in there and the ladies are nice and helpful..they even sweettalked my boyfriend into having some tea as he generally hates it.
WZmLwAb2g5Unn7oo0rB6wg : I've only once been to the Asgard 1) on any day other than Wednesday and 2) before 9 p.m.  That said, I'm there every week. The karaoke is the best in Boston and the karaoke crowd is one of the best ones you can ever hope to find at a watering hole on a weekday night. I adore the Asgard. You should too.
S9OXWczRNh3oDLf-_GiFVg : These burritos are fine.  Well, fine if you've never actually eaten a burrito before.  I mean, they're edible at least.  And hey, I'm sure there are those people who love romaine lettuce in their burritos.  That's cool if you're into that.
eIjqkjxyYozY21-pBkb_2Q : It's noisy, crowded and a bit pricy (considering you're ordering fast food items done slowly).  But with all of that said, the burger I got (The Broadway: melted swiss, onions, bacon, and jalapenos, served on toasted sourdough rye) was really good. The waiter never asked for how I would like it to be cooked, and I forgot to ask, so it arrived pretty pink and juicy.  So if you like your burgers well done, be sure to ask for that specifically.  The only thing I didn't like were the onion straws which I got for a side.  Basically pieces of fried nothing; there was little discernible onion inside the stringy bits of fried... whatever.  Worth going with a small group overall.
O5exppRaS0_48SdufB38Xg : This place is delicious! I've never had to wait to get a table, service is great, food is delicious. I've never felt rushed to order, eat, or pay... The atmosphere is also very nice...  I would definitely recommend this place!
6oVdV8dK7z8YvhbAy30dBg : Awww, little brother! You're almost growed up now!
u718U3rMyxz77ot04Qejuw : As far as cleanliness and food quality goes, I think Gourmet Kingdom and 35 are about even. They're both in older buildings, and I've never really been impressed by the food at either. It's not bad, but since it's a buffet the food just sits under the heatlamp all day. Gourmet Kingdom's strong point is size - they do have about twice as much space as 35, including more room to move between the rows of food. They also have a much larger selection of dishes, with quite a few vegetarian options. On the other hand, I've never seen more than just a few tables of people there at any given time, and with a buffet that big I don't think they switch out the food as often as they should. The staff is friendly, but the service is just average.
OW4e2IaesUEtEuDPlaQZLA : I'm not a connoisseur of pearl drinks and such, but I stopped here last week for a cheap drink and got the bubble milk tea for 99 cents. It was incredibly good. They have so many different drinks on the menu that I wish I'd discovered this place earlier. So check it out some time, right outside the Durant Food Court ("Asian" Ghetto).
k95JYLlT120QTMzZFkgfDw : This arena is pretty amazing for what they hold. I've been here for music festivals, New Years, Daft Punk 2007, and each time they always make everything extravagent and over the top. This place is just plain enormous, though not somewhere you'd get lost in if you observe the basic layout.  Expect all events held here to be huge, in size and quality.  Easily gets dirty here, and there's a tendency to close off sections due to capacity issues.
hVaPlNsR19foSIrLwflfXw : Came here on one cold and blustery April evening (a week after opening). So what better thing to do than to get some frozen yogurt!!  This new store offers about 5 flavors at a time, but the number of toppings is quite numerous. So I'm not sure what the 21 choices part is about, but I guess I'll discover that soon enough.  I got Strawberry and the 98% fat free Vanilla in the tres small bowl. My fella ordered the Caramel Cappuccino in the tres small. We went out the door for only $5. A bit pricier than Golden Spoon for sure, but less expensive than any of the Pinkberry's or Cefiore's out there.  I asked about the calorie and fat count on the strawberry. I was told that the strawberry is only 30 calories per ounce and fat free. The tres small is only 4 ounces. But as far as the other flavors you'd have to ask. They don't have nutritional info available online nor in the store. Bummer.
rO9CEUeoQCbrRs6PdcJO0g : Food is not good, that keeps it from 4 stars.  In a party of 10-12 people, no one liked their food (my chili was the best of the bunch) - lots of draft beer choices, very quiet on a Sunday which is good imo.  Pool is relatively cheap and we were able to get a table easily.  Atmosphere was good. Waitstaff quasi attentive.  Its ok, not great, but ok.
MY5gpiU2AlxFYQ9NxZM1nQ : The food is great, but customer service is horrible! The last 3 times, I went there, I called my order in and I had to wait an additional 20-30 minutes for my order. And, the lady at the register attitude stinks!!
YGt4p1RIcsswzG_mesTVrg : The only excuse to come to Earl's should be for a 21 run and even then I would not suggest it.   I appreciate a deal as much as the next person, but when it comes to drinks, I would rather pay a couple extra dollars in order to get something that I am actually going to enjoy. Yes, it is true that you can order a strong drink for a fairly good price, but honestly when you live on or around a college campus you could go to a party and get the same crappy drink for even cheaper and you don't have to be 21.   The one time I came here I ordered a White Russian ($6). I was in shock the entire time the bartender made my drink. He started off by making it in a beer glass. Classy! Apparently they do not know that this cocktail belongs in a lowball glass. He put a bit of ice into the glass, grabbed the bottle of vodka and did not stop pouring until the beer glass was half full. The other half consisted of the kahlúa and about enough cream to stick in my eye. I ended up giving the drink to my friend, so in the long run it would have been a better deal to buy a more expensive, pleasant-tasting cocktail instead of giving away a $6 drink that made me gag.   The Dude would be so disappointed.
MumNKz2LIaMUjIImZjXrnA : Get in and get out, or try to get a seat! I love it. Huuuuuge portions that feel healthy and are v yummy. I usually get the salad with poppyseed on the side and then get the tuna on honey wheat with one of the many fab fresh juices!
vnoMAfj9LGNUe4Y-kaOc_w : This place is walking distance from my work and is quickly becoming a slow day delight!    When you walk in your sense are easily confused between the smell of the grill and the sweet smell of fresh bread.  Sliding into one of the counter seats, the friendly wait staff takes your order and chats with you while you wait.  There is something so simple and comforting about a really good burger.  Your burger arrives sitting alone on a white salad plate.  The freshly made bun hugs the patty, tomato, onions, and lettuce.  Its juicy and delicious.  The burgers are not gigantic, so you don't leave feeling over-full.   The pies are authentic, the crust reminds me of my nana's pie crust.  I've only had the apple pie, but it was good.  Tender apple's with a good mix of spices.    Good thing to note... it's cash only!
CZtz8avoCj4l7pbd7AMmqQ : This little shop is adorable :) It's a quick walk from the Harvard T stop. I originally stopped by because of a display of adorable cell phone straps they had outside the shop, and was instantly greeted by a cheerful store clerk. I told her I was just looking, so she let me be without constantly pestering me or trying to sell me anything. The store itself is laid out so that there is plenty of open space to walk between the displays, making it look very welcoming. I returned to the shop a few months later to pick up a bento box. It was then that I realized they don't have a lot of variety in items - usually if you find something nice, there's only one of it still remaining in the store. I also looked for 20 minutes before I could find a pair of chopsticks in a holder box, haha. It was worth it, though, because there are still a lot of novelty items for sale at a decent price. Minus one star for the lack of inventory (while I was there, I had my eye on a certain bento box, but a lady standing next to me reached for it first, and they didn't have any more in the store *sadface*).   Nevertheless, it's a cute shop to buy some novelty gifts, especially if you're a fan of Miyazaki's works (Totoro, Kiki, Spirited Away, etc.) and/or random Japanese knick-knacks.
4MWMDiDFM35yc6WSv2Ukkg : I really do love this place - and I love having dinner at the bar.  I've had sketchy service in the restaurant when it's busy, but who hasn't?  I don't hold that against them.  Love the eggplant, love all the tapas, loved it during Restaurant Week.  And love all the fancy cocktails and the knowledgeable bar staff.  One of my favorite places in the Square...
TwMRm7cT0rqSdxPGLj6ixw : La Burrita - a haiku:  Authentic it's not But super carne so yum Load up free salsa.
uz9wcN47R5ycMRkDh_0HmA : Since Bonne Soiree is closing at the end of the month, this review maybe more of an obituary than a helpful musing.  After learning that they were closing, I immediately made a reservation.  I had been wanting to try Bonne Soiree for years, trying to find a good chance to go for a special occasion, but it never happened...and it was now or never to try this famed restaurant.  Bonne Soiree is a small, tucked away restaurant in a somewhat unstable complex on Franklin St. of other restaurants and businesses.  Not sure that this was a great location for them.  They're really tucked away, and with the parking fiasco there years ago, I'm not sure anyone new would have found them.  But then again, I think that's what they're going for: discreet, exclusive dining.  The dining room itself is beautiful with light blue walls, scones, artwork, and hardwood floors.  As someone who researches menus weeks in advance, it was a bit frustrating that Bonne Soiree doesn't post a menu online...they don't even have a website (another element of exclusivity?)  I think that was a miscue,  at the very least they should have a basic site with their info and a high level overview of items they may serve.  With only 16 Yelp reviews and a scattering of other reviews - it doesn't give me a lot to work with.  One thing that can't be debated is their service.  Impeccable from beginning to end.  Starting with taking my jacket, pulling out my chair for me, refolding my napkin when I walked away, filling up my water glass so I never got more than a few sips in, a through run-through of the menu, wine recommendations, hand-written calligraphy bill, and speedy pick up of my jacket when we left.  Everyone was great, each attendee seems to work every table.  We prob. had about 4-5 people wait on us in one way or another through our dinner.  Which brings me to the best part, the dinner. I was a bit scared of the $250 bill I had heard of earlier by Christina G.  We went to Bonne Soiree on a Wed night, there was no special occasion to celebrate so we played it low key and spent....$190.  Way more than I wanted to spend, and to piggy back on what Christina G. said for that money I was happy, but I wasn't $190 happy.  Here's the breakdown:  -Opted not to do the flight of wine (since I'd read mixed reviews) - started with a half glass of wine wine each, and they paired a full glass of red with dinner.  I like that they give you the option of half and full glasses - but since you never see a wine list you have no concept of how much the wines cost.  In hindsight I should have asked for a price range or some idea of cost.  The impeccable service of just bringing wine to the table is great, but not everyone who wants to dine at Bonne Soiree can throw around money.  -First course - their scallop and small caesar salad.  $16+ for the scallop - that's right one scallop, but it was good.  Paired with a terrific sauce, caviar, califlower, it was a great start.  Caesar was great with lardons for about $12.  -Second course - Duck and Lamb.  Duck was good, but it wasn't outstanding, lacked some of the rich flavor that I grew accustomed to of duck in France (and that I was expecting at Bonne Soiree).  Lamb was terrific.  Both entrees were in the $32-36 range.  -Dessert - their pot de creme and Elizabeth Taylor - very rich chocolate desserts that helped define a true French dining experience.  Capped of the dinner nicely.  I'm very happy that I tried Bonne Soiree before they closed.  Now the issue is the gap in fine French restaurants in the Triangle.  After losing my beloved Bistro 604 on Glenwood years ago, I've found that Coquette and Vin Rouge have been great replacements, but they don't have that refined element that Bonne Soiree presented.  Anyone know of any other great French restaurants in the area?  I've been wanting to try Provence in Carrboro and Savoy and Saint Jacques in Raleigh.    Until then,  I'll remember my visit to Bonne Soiree with utmost fondness!
O-OnMA4P6wX8Qa-oFUReCg : I went to Coffee Break for dinner with a friend.  Being first timer, wasn't sure what to get, but as I waited, I studied their menu.  This place is small and I can say, if it got busy, you'll have to wait for your seats.  The ordering process:  You order first, pay and then seat yourself.  Then they will bring the food to you and once you are done, drop it off by the counter by the door.  Its lot of self-serve!  So I ended up ordering Spicy Pork and Spicy Rice Cake.  They have lot of spicy dishes - like spicy tofu, chicken, etc.  I'll have to give others a try next time I go...   So, the food comes in a tray, which has your main dish, side of kimchi, bean sprouts and miso soup.  The miso soup was okay, I had better, but it helps to have a soup when eating the food.  The kimchi was good and bean sprouts was okay.  I really enjoyed the spicy pork.  It was spicy and delicious.  I think the meat was marinated prior to cooking, but I really enjoyed the the spicy pork!  I would recommend it!  The spicy rice cake was excellent, lot better than Maru.  I would recommend this dish as well.  Overall, my first visit, I was impressed with their food.  Give the place a try and judge it for yourself!
p1WL5-Ywua4vumvbpxd-5g : The main dining area is small with varying levels on which to eat. The service is pretty quick and friendly but the dining area is stuffy and cramped.  The menu has some innovative items but for the most part is basic. The specials are reasonably priced and the portions are near perfect. Just enough to fill you up but not americanized over indulgence. The beer menu is decent and it is always nice to have a local beer with your meal. The deserts are nothing special but the size and presentation make them irresistible for some reason. I recommend one of the more innovative menu items, take some chances.
OxDDAaJOK-GIzCWr_b8odA : I didn't think it was possible, but I received a Sourdough Breakfast Sandwich that looked EXACTLY like the picture. Well, like the picture years upon years ago when that item wasn't part of the hidden menu.  It was perfect. No crushed bun, perfectly piping hot (a little too hot, actually) all the way through. Not greasy. Perfect. This is what all other Jacks in their Boxes should aspire to after all the clouds have gone to bed.  But hot damn, turn down the speed on the girl in the drive through. A very bubbly, super friendly teenage girl wearing braces took my card and handed me my food all with the vocal pace of a auctioneer high on PCP.  Her parts to be read about 30x faster than any mortal human speaks:  Her: HELLOTHEREHOWAREYOUTONIGHTTHETOTALISTHREESEVENTYSEVENDOYOUWANTKETCHUPORHOTSAUCEFORTHESANDWICH  Me: Umm..

oqwlrr8kQPhX7Z2eOw6DSw : I always hit up this cafe whenever I'm in Claremont for boba or coffee. Hidden behind a sports bar with it's own private lot, CK Cafe is the perfect place for late(r than Starbucks or other generic coffeehouses) night studies or just hanging out. Their location, as other reviews have stated, may be hard to find for newcomers, but there's an easy entrance to CK's private lot on 1st Street. Personally, I find this cafe's location to be awesome; since the patio faces out to the parking lot, there are really no outside distractions.  CK Cafe's boba is amazing to my life. There are very few boba places in the surrounding areas that are even semi-decent, but CK's bubble makes me jolly. The tapioca balls are perfect, firm yet soft and chewy. The coffee is pretty good, too. A notch above Starbucks quality for you coffee connoisseurs. The variety of teas that they have are also superb, but I've only ordered tea from this place once or twice.  What sets this cafe apart from other coffeehouses in my mind is the service and hospitality that Mr. Pong and his wife exude. They genuinely care about their customers and do remember orders if you're a regular. The ambiance of this place is pretty cool, too. Random night and Alice in Wonderland murals with comfortable chairs all around. The outside patio includes a canopy and plastic chairs with tables and ashtrays. You'll often find Mr. Pong smoking a cigarette here.  The age range varies, but there are usually more college kids around just hanging out and chatting. This presence is probably because Claremont Colleges are down the street. There are also professors sitting inside, usually talking to each other and enjoying a cup of coffee.   Free wireless, board games, books, and lots of random munchies such as chips and cookies but no real 'hot' food items, as they don't have a kitchen. I always like being greeted by Mr. Pong, too. Great cafe overall.
soyY0oqEHTFu_iVoVGZVYA : My previous review was quite complimenting of Mad Mex but unfortunately I feel it has taken a turn for the worst.  As another user posted the bouncers are ridiculous with id check and are extremely rude.  Service is extremely slow and often the kitchen closes earlier than it should.  I've gone on nights at midnight when they are open till 2 and it's been closed.  Some half off special then after 11...  I definitely do not go here as much as I used to.
4zPgNYgO3j5kNVH5iAh2PQ : Beer battered fries are delishhh...I usually get a grilled chicken which is usually always good too. Sometimes, I feel this place is overrated, but it's mostly good so 5 stars!
HzCNw7rPIiEYMlsQ6ScayQ : The definition of a college BAR.
IirtDN171BDKPSTBl3mtow : With so many sandwich places in Blacksburg, it can be over whelming to choose one. I'll tell you this, ditch all the chains like Subway, Quizonos, and (I say this with much regret as nothing beats this place at 2am)..Jimmy Johns, and give this place a try. It is cheap and the sandwiches are HUGE. Their menu is very extensive with everything from wraps, to some mexican specialties, and regular sandwiches.
bqU5eZe4yeQvhQMu2aJCfg : Despite that it was snowing last time I went, I HAD to stop by. Being from California, it's not everyday I get the opportunity to experience such enticing ice cream.  I dragged my sister and mom along. We were all shivering and NOT in the mood for ice cream. I was determined to go though.  Thank goodness we did! Once we got over the cute faux grass & cow decor, we proceeded to the menu. Aside from more traditional flavors, they also have a selection of specialty ones. The Kahlua & Bailey's flavors were a hit with us coffee-lovers.  Despite the weather, there was a steady flow of people going in for ice cream and coffee, and thankfully the heater was on to a good temperature so that we didn't freeze inside while eating.  Will definitely drop by again when I hit the East Coast.
YELJlgSsIer7nrs05lQVQg : This place is totally ridiculous.  But seriously, there is no better place to get a drunk-dog or greasy fries at 2AM.  Plus the food is ready in like seconds or perhaps my sense of space and time is slightly altered.
sgQX7n9HVEp4vZ_fyyxF9A : My friend and I shared the cinnamon twist........ YUM.. KEEP ME AWAY FROM HERE, it's very dangerous. I swore to never eat a donut again when I was about 15. I still have not eaten a donut since then, but this place is tempting me. Cinnamon twists are not donuts, by the way (or so I tell myself).
7ttXNX2_ykzLrek_SesAxA : I'll make this short, sweet and to the point...   The muffins are the best I've ever had... DELICIOUS!!!!!    Dunking your muffins in raspberry jam?? Who does that??? I dunno but I love it!! I had to order a dozen to take home and share with the family...  : )
B0HMOQzsPS4KRsyxiYcdAg : Have you seen "Babette's Feast?" More importantly, have you seen the final scene -- when the Danish elders succumb to indulgence and start smiling at each bite of their dinner?  That's Hungry Mother.   I think we almost ordered the whole menu: country ham and biscuits, crab first course, roast chicken entree, sides of collards, creamed corn and the cornbread with sorghum butter.   Oh. My God.   And apple bread pudding with bourbon sauce. Or maybe it was just bourbon.  Also the wine of the day and a glass of the "delicious beer from somewhere". Perfect companion to our menu selections.  Thanks to our server for helping us choose an excellent meal on a rainy night. It was the best warmer-upper I could ask for.   --- An aside: I dig the warm lighting and home-y feel, but I'd love to see some art on those white, white walls.
zfsm29ZDlDwYTdQNO2dORg : This is an awesome yogurt shop! So fresh tasting.  In fact, they make it up fresh (with fresh fruit) in the back.  My banana tasted like real banana, not that fake banana liquor-tasting flavor.  The vanilla bean was to die for.  I love my frozen yogurt and next to this place Yogurtland is my favorite.  I just wish they had more flavors and more stores other than Claremont and Pasadena.  Please, open some up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
GKwNLCAkA22uCGu3kqGMLg : I just tried this cute restaurant this last week with some friends. Great ambiance, perfect place to catch up with people, but the service was iffy. The waiter took awhile to place our order and at the end, he accidentally charged one of our friend's credit cards twice and it took a lil while to get it straightened out. But whatever...all I care about is the food quality.   We started with a bread that the waiter brought to our table. AMAZING!!! A hot, fluffy loaf of bread with tomato sauce on the top and an oil dipping sauce to go with it. Just that alone has me coming back for more. I also ordered the tortellini della mama  for dinner. The cream sauce is rich and delicious. Mixed with the tortellini and prosciutto...it's heaven.   Great thing was were weren't rushed here. They have a big menu selection so I will have to go back and check out what else they offer. Definitely a cute looking place for date night. :)
PnF9KrcvrtY6yxh8DvCrBQ : I really think this is the best place for Mediterranean food (even though I am Chinese and even if most of the workers are Hispanic). I haven't gone in a year so decided to go yesterday, and it hasn't changed! The quality of the food is still good.   There were two of us, we ordered a Chicken Tarna Plate. Basically it includes two bread wraps, three sides of sauce (hummus, garlic sauce, and another bean sauce...), the marinated but not salty chicken, and vegetables (radish, lettuce, and whole jalapeno peppers). The plate was $9.18 but it was a good deal because we split the plate in half and basically was paying for two wraps anyway.   Like most gyro places, the meat is rotating and is constantly cooking/kept warm on a pole. This may look unsanitary but it is quite clean and REALLY good. I especially liked the hummus and the garlic sauce which brought out even more flavor with the vegetables and the chicken.   Definitely a must try if you are in the Pasadena area!
UA0F3RgCm5UQfthoWxetPQ : YKS is simply the best! Have been going for 5 years and it has been life-changing. Naader Shagagi is the best yoga master in CA, or possibly the US. I no longer get migraines, my lower back pain is gone, and I am much more able to cope with life's stresses. His studio combines body/mind/spirit, as yoga is supposed to do. This is not an exercise class or gym. Attend one of Naader's classes with an open mind, and you will get as much from the words he says as you do from the poses. I recommend him highly to both friends and strangers. And I drive from Long Beach to Pasadena because every class is transforming. Naader and YKS rule!!!
8gmDmPQgDuAUiWHfTEu0Kw : What a treat to stay on campus. The staff is wonderful here and were most accommodating. I stayed two nights and enjoyed my stay. The complimentary breakfast is nice and they serve coffee and tea all day long as well, in case you sleep through breakfast hours. It's very close to North campus and you can walk mostly anywhere on campus anyway.  The rooms are clean and spacious. The bathroom was clean and the room had an iron, ironing board and television, all the modern necessities. The staff was helpful and offered free wifi access and a list of nearby restaurants. It was also nice that from LAX the super shuttle can drop you off right in front of the guest house (for $16). Otherwise, the bus station is nearby the guest house or you can take the shuttle from Westwood from the Flyaway bus.  They also offer complimentary parking, which is a huge plus since parking on campus can be expensive.
Rt30kctv4KLlpevv90KciQ : Lunch buffet + drink for $10!   The food they offered at the buffet was nothing to rave about, but where else will you find all you can eat Indian food for $10? In the little corner of the restaurant was a buffet set up that had offered: basmati rice, a fried rice like dish, tandoori chicken, chicken marsala, curry chicken, fish curry, cottage cheese curry, and a few other entrees.   There was also a plethora of salad fixings, sauces, and a couple desserts. The selection is limited and the quality is three stars at best.   Nevertheless, the ambiance was cozy,  the service was very friendly and the waiter struck up conversation and kept a watchful eye to remove dirty plates and fill drinks.  The great thing about this place is that  you won't get the evil eye for going up and getting another helping of food.
i_6FEByPpCYsm3vKImvAhg : This place is actually pretty good for being campus food. It has the most 'restaurant vibe' to it and is perfect if you want to get away from the hustle and bustle of academia for a little while.  I got the butternut squash soup and it was very delicious. It had a creamy consistency with a subtle hint of butternut. It was a decent amount of food (which is nice because I hate walking around campus carrying my leftover food) .  The price here is about maybe a little over a $1 more than the prices you'd find at the rest of the on campus food places. For me, that was perfectly fine in exchange for a nice atmosphere to enjoy my lunch in.  **They also have comfy seating on the side for those of you who want to just grab a drink and do some reading :)
3BIIC080zzL3LtBLQIqpFQ : Cheap taco tuesday....  TT:  dolla tacos (carne asada, chicken, or carnitas), 3 dolla margaritas  1.  First, I'm laughing a Mike C's prior review about not having the runs after eating here.   It's so true because when I thought of eating at El Torito, I thought yikes, I'm eating at risk here.  However, I haven't been here in years and this is what my girl picked out for HH, so why not?!  I'll get my diaper ready....  2.  I was surprised to come in and see a "taco station" to the right with ladies rolling out freshly made tortillas.  So basically you order your tacos with the waitress and bring the receipt to the taco ladies to make for you.  By the way, our waitress Jenn was awesome!  3.  My carnitas tacos were pretty good, not the best, but not the worst!  I didn't try the chicken and the carne asada was kinda fatty, but still ok.  Can't beat $3 dolla margaritas!  Didn't savor any but you can read Mike C's review for the low down...  4.  Didn't need the diaper! Yipeee!
opOX9Ys-49bPKGnXQMOOEQ : STILL GREAT. Earl grey ice cream- whaaat? It was refreshing in so many ways and I want it RIGHT NOW. I sampled a good bunch of flavors, I can't remember them all but I remember them being unique and tasty!
CTT_DnO69ixfFT_5oD6HaQ : First, let's correct a slight misconception.  This is not exactly Chicago-style pizza.  Although it may not seem possible to those whose conception of pizza centers on the east coast or California styles, Papa Del's thick crust is noticeably doughier, thicker, heavier, and more casserole-like than anything being served at a classic Chicago-style pizza place.  Our of respect for pizza aficionados, I have to note that there's a slight difference in kind, not degree, between what Giordano's serves and what Papa Del's serves.  But second, it's still fantastic pizza.  It may seem pricey, but an 8-piece thick crust pizza can easily serve 4-6 because the slices are so filling and thick (it can feed 7 if you're like me and always have 6 sorority girls on diets hanging out with you).  The tomato sauce is delicious and perfectly-spiced and with the doughy crust it forms almost a focaccia taste (like a real focaccia taste and not what you get at Friday's).  The meat toppings are the best (bacon, pepperoni, and sausage are all great).  I would advise against getting onions, as they can overpower the rest of the pizza, but it's still very, very good thick-crust pizza and it's well worth the lengthy wait.  It's not a 5-star because the dine-in service/experience is poor.  I strongly, strongly recommend getting take-out.  Also note the calender; if it's an Illinois home football or basketball game, call 60-90 minutes in advance and do not try to eat-in.  And the thin crust is lousy.
cjP0dfuT1xTax19QHRB2lg : Good food and very generous. For $7.99, I had a plate filled with plenty of food. I ordered #9 -- the shrimp enchiladas. Delicious! The location isn't perfect but it's a pleasant surprise in the neighborhood. Brightly lit, carefully decorated, and cozy.   The parking lot was small but it's not crowded in the evening, so you ought to be fine. Finding street parking in this part of town can be a nightmare otherwise.  They accept most credit cards, including American Express.
W_tFDar-UftgW3AeJklIrw : After a 6-mile hike, my boyfriend and I were pretty much exhausted. Starting and ending the hike at Little Woodrow's, we decided to try Ginger Man instead. The crowd is yuppified, and college boys, but the beer selection is pretty good: they even had ciders: I think I had the woodchuck cider, which tastes like fermented apple juice. The AC was a bit too cold (then again we were sweaty) and the bar was super crowded, but it was a good experience.
EpIPovnxzk1uQ3fmcGVusw : Living in Atlanta and never having been to The Cheetah is like living in Paris without ever going to The Louvre. Or perhaps it's more in line with visiting Dublin and missing the Guinness Factory. You get the point.  Cheetah is Atlanta's legendary strip club. I support my claim to this status with a reminder that Jay Z raps about the club. This upscale, classy (can I say that about a strip club? Yes.) establishment is loaded with young attractive strippers. Buckhead business men love it, visiting men love it - basically any guy with an abundance of dollar bills will be in paradise. I went with my ex-boyfriend and his friends for a birthday (figuring I could keep an eye on them all) and actually had a fun time. No, I am not anxious to return, but I will recommend it as a one time unique experience everyone living in Atlanta should have. Just sit back, relax, and laugh. And if you are a gentlemen, certainly clean out the atm beforehand.
ZcMRlly1bFhz5Ggb6rJkoQ : OK, if you are from Chicago, I think you would be outraged at the name of this joint, so don't bother coming!    the place is located before central square.  the workers there are like zombies. they don't greet you. even when they rang me up, they didn't tell me a price. i had to lean in, look at the register, and be like "$5.50?". yeah, a little strange. It is certainly not great pizza. i couldn't really taste the sauce, and the cheese wasn't all that tasty. it is thin, and i liked the crispy, out of the oven style of it, but that's about it.   I didn't give it 1 star, because the pizza was edible, and not worthy of me completely trashing this place, but I do not recommend coming here, and if you were very hungry, and nothing else was open, than maybe.
ok0YdfQIz0e4R6rOV3w25Q : I don't know why I didn't write this review earlier, after a horrible experience at another salon, which I really regret and I should just have gone back to Dale (i was thinking to try out a new place, so stupid...) anyways, Dale was just great!!!! I have long hair and I'm really picky about my hair cut; I would be depressed for weeks if my hair came out wrong. Dale is really sweet and easy to talk to, he really listens to what you want and he works fast. He's just so gentle and everything, the whole process was very pleasant. I love him!!! I wanted a very simple trim (not too much) and low layered, it came out perfectly and it grew our very nicely, that's very important!! I would definitely go back, this is my to-go place in Berkeley, no more trying...
hpmwM8OuRjBvBg7qik1bQQ : I don't know what to make of this store. I've been in a few times and had long chats with the owner, who then has no recollection of me on subsequent trips. That's just strange. The yarn selection is nothing special, and I found many of the yarns were priced far above suggested retail, which is really strange considering the neighborhood. I haven't been in for a few months and I probably won't be coming back unless I hear something that changes my mind.
10KPSp3hDG_IQSD5zVKPGg : All I can say is that their sandwiches are so big you can save the money and hassle of buying two meals in a day and just get one of their sandwiches and an extra side (pasta or potato salad or fruit) and save the other half for later. Plus... the location is really convenient.
wmbeb49ApjYCwBgK-BNo4A : Very solid pizza delivery place. I'll point out that it is an Asian pizza delivery place. They have pizza egg rolls. Similarly to the delivery Chinese places, you can get a free item with an order over a certain size.  The prices are very affordable, especially considering their prime location on Craig Street. It's clear that they made and priced the menu with the goal of one-upping all of their competitors by pricing everything just a little cheaper. Every pizza comes with a free free drink. Gourmet extra-large 18'' pizzas are $12.99. You can add free vegetables to hoagies.  How is the food? It's really pretty good. This is not the How Lee of pizza delivery places. The pizza isn't Mineo's, but it is decidedly better than Vocelli's or Domino's. The only real complaint I have is that they don't make their own Italian dressing. It's the yellow kind.
S2gmW8hDnOcmy5NXnF2X0g : terrible service. the brunch fondue looked intriguing so we asked the waiter about the serving size. the menu claimed it'd accomodate 2 people but we wanted to make sure. the waiter said, 'you can add some vegetables and it should be ok.' so we agreed to that.  he rarely came back out to help us the entire time. then when we got the bill, he charged us for *2* fondues. i went in and disputed the charge and he finally credited us for one of them. however, after keeping track of the credit card statement, it appears that he never refunded the fondues.  this is still in dispute and i want to make sure you no one makes the mistake of going here.  ps - panera's food is better than this and i don't even like panera.
c3qizEmZ5PBU03EM2xqrOA : When I finally sat down and could fully absorb the decor of Distrito, I could help but think freaky 70's Mexican disco porn. I like pink but not that much pink. And the lucha libre masks ? Along with the waiter/waitress outfits, I get the whimsical nature behind the decor...but i just didn't get it, if that makes sense ?Maybe that side of my brain wasn't tuned in that.    Nonetheless, the food was delicious. The tapas small plate style was spot on, especially considering that we were dining rather late. The vegetarian spinach tamale   was light, smooth and flavorful. The guacamole was creamy, balanced with a little acidity. And while nachos are on page one of "Cooking Mexican For Dummies" the nachos carnitas (sp?) were well prepared. Yet the star of the evening was the grapefruit margarita. Perfect.  And this is coming from a guy who's not a huge cocktail person. Swift and attentive service with a smile. I just think eating dinner in a swing is  kind of kinky.
n37KreWvZO-uw2vE4PD_6w : Elbow Room was the first restaurant I've tried on the Ellsworth Ave strip between Negley and College.  Considering that I've already been here for almost half a year, living only a couple blocks away, I should frequent this block much more often.  I came here for a simple dinner with a lab partner.  The lighting is relatively dim, with dark wood finishes and all that.  however, the crowd overall wasn't quite the couples on a romantic date type thing, so don't filter this place out if you just want to hang out with a couple friends - that exact crowd occupied the majority of the restaurant that night.  Based on the previous reviews and my experience, there is always an insert in the menu with seasonal items.  I got one of their crusted tilapia dishes, which on the menu, is served with regular fries and other things, but not sweet potato fries.  I kindly asked my server whether the substitution for sweet potato fries could be make, and she gladly fulfilled my request without charging me any extra.  my friend got the beef bourguignon, which tasted average.  for any of my friends who come to town to visit me, I'll probably take them here for its location and non-bar-type food options. the waitstaff is friendly, and i'm looking forward to coming here again to try an item off their extensive dessert menu.
_AZ3H8VoJgt9BVFaoX5_tA : I had to give them at least "one star" to write the review. But they do not even deserve one.   I had my WORST apartment hunting experience with them. I requested for short-term furnished housing, however they refuses to show me the actual apartment. They only provided you a lot of pictures.  The agent is NOT FRIENDLY and PUSHY (like a mean Avon sales lady).    What happened to me is that after we already had a mutual agreement taking one of their apartment, they leased it to another tenant before I give them the check.    I doubt the integrity of Seamless Transition, and will never trust them again.
Lts-qkgRS1ujNFCMuj-27Q : I like Hungry's but there are a couple things that can be an issue. First, the bad:  I once got the cocktail of the day (some sort of margarita) and it was not good at all. It was supposed to be some sort of berry concoction but it was not fruity at all. For future reference, try before you order!  Also as others have mentioned: the service is not the best at times. But if you are just going out on a Friday night for a chill time, it won't bother you.  Now for the good:  Lots of veggie options :)  Tomato basil soup is the best I've had... ever. The wedge salad is also really good. The hummus is delicious as well.  The black bean burger is alright. Much better than any sort of frozen burger but I've had better.  Overall, Hungry's is a dependable neighborhood joint with a good vibe and good food.
hSUQO8tjXRTLOsBjBtz5lA : Lotus House is great for hungry, college students. However, I would NOT bring my parents here. I ordered pineapple fried rice, but the rice and chicken were hard and tasteless. The place doesn't look that clean, and I think they used day-old rice to make their fried rice platters. I'm just not a big fan of any places in the Asian ghetto anymore, and I definitely won't be coming back to Lotus House anytime soon.
pPMuO6xgAZTKxCcndAmdow : My visit today left me a bit disappointed. My girlfriend and I found ourselves with an afternoon free after the American Chemical Society convention and decided to visit Cambridge and the Fogg and Sackler museums at Harvard.    My disappointment stems from the fact that almost half of the galleries at the Sackler and one at the Fogg museum were closed.  We were able to see almost every open exhibit in under 2 hours and 45 minutes.  I had hoped to make a full afternoon of it but we simply ran out of things to see.    In addition one of the curators at the Sackler museum saw fit to admonish me for 'excessive pointing' at the paintings.  Apparently one must maintain 2 feet of separation from the works and refrain from any sudden movements when pointing out a detail of a carving or painting.   Right.  Overall, what works we could see were interesting and in good condition.  I especially enjoyed the Sketches in Clay exhibit at the Fogg museum.    Personally I didn't feel as though I got my $9 worth.  If the galleries had been open and I wasn't treated like a naughty child by the staff this might have been different.
SRg4H0qd3BiG_VBEHWx7NA : I love Intermezzo. I eat here at least once a week. The salads are amazing and huge (well, depending on who makes them). You can make incredibly smart and healthy choices here quite easily.   Incredibly economical, too! Their prices did go up $0.50, though...
TPH4uJLsriwmwULQ4DRSjA : This place is Awesome! Chicken saga is tender and flavorful. Coworkers really like the jelfrese. Don't miss the cheese or garlic naan! YUM!
fcDt16yP9Q7tzuv7hdinsw : the bbq here is pretty good, but honestly ive had better, and to top it off, it's way too expensive for what it's actually worth.    sorry, mo's.
_SvOo2p8AIpwVKN4mfe2rg : pics and review: http://dailydonato.blogspot.com   Malbec, a fairly new argentinian restaurant, was referred by numerous Chow Hounder's and received high reviews and praise on Yelp. Sounded perfect. I had high expectations. My husby made reservations several weeks ahead of time. We were set for a 3:30 dinner reservation.  As we walked up the shade covered concrete of Green St., we could see through the windows a dining room filled with people. Thank goodness we got there early, or so we thought. We arrived 15 minutes prior and could not find a host(ess) at the restaurant station positioned on the sidewalk. A 4 top was ahead of us and was waiting for a host(ess) too. They were finally acknowledged but had them wait just a few minutes more while they acclimated the seating area.   Meanwhile, we were not being helped even though we were recognized. I was tempted just helping ourselves sit at one of the several available tables on the outdoor patio. At approximately 3:40pm I walked inside trying to flag any of the employees. The gentleman who had helped the family ahead of us looked up and I asked him if there was anyone who could help us, we had reservations for 3:30 and had been waiting outside for several minutes already.   More minutes pass by and it was clear that this dining experience would be a long and hellish one. I spotted the first flag. I should've walked back out to our car and gone someplace else. I should've yelled, "Eff this!" But I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt. I came up to a busboy clearing off a table and I asked him if we could just seat ourselves to the clean and empty table out front. He gestured to do so and 20 minutes after our reservation time, we had sat down.  Our waiter came to our table without menus and asked us if we were ready to order. Oh, and apparently our names were not on the list of reservations for the time we requested. I called several other restaurants asking about their current wait times hoping we could get in for a better experience. No such luck. After he apologized for the confusion, we were on track with ordering our meals; two appetizers, a bottle of wine, two waters and our entrees. Maybe things would turn around??  Our bottle of wine arrived first, a full bodied Malbec.  Then arrived our bread with chimichurri dipping sauce. 15 mintues later arrived our single order of empanadas accompanied by a small side salad. There was miscommunication with the order and we ended up receiving two orders instead of one.  We devoured a whole basket of bread in no time. Refills please!  The couple who had arrived before us were placing their dessert order and next to us a yelp couple was being seated and placing their orders. We dropped in on their conversation to hear that they too had hear great things about this place. For their sake I had hoped that they would having a better time.  Half a bottle later, more bread and you guessed it, another half hour passing by, our "starter" of Costa Patagonia, a dish of shrimp, calamari and scallops in a red paprika and garlic sauce, arrived. The dish was bland and screaming for acid.  My husby said how it would be hilarious, given our luck, if we ended up consuming the entire bottle of wine well before our entrees arrived. Sure enough we emptied the bottle, mind you finally receiving our waters (thank god), before we ate our entrees. Joking aside we were very disappointed with the lack of service and lack of warmth that reviewers had praised Malbec so highly for. We did not get that whatsoever. Even the yelp couple kept looking at their watch and waiting.  Finally over two hours later from the moment we sat down our entrees arrived and the couples' next to us did too. Interesting. However the couple waiting on their dessert, did not get their sweet treat still.  Overall we were completely dissatisfied with our time spent. The food paired with the horrendous service made for an unpleasant evening and would not likely return. We wanted to have a romantic time with outsanding service but only got poor service. If I could turn back time I would choose someplace else to dine.  When we were ready to go (three hours earlier) the couple who have been here longer than us have just gotten their dessert. Here's my review. I'd hate to read theirs
HkHyXMGHh3sYVWy60hZCuw : I guess this place is good enough for a small town like Champaign.  Let me get this out first, this place is NOTHING compared to the great Red Mango. BUT If you haven't had red mango, you would probably like Cocomero.   I like Cocomero, but I really do think it's too expensive for froyo. (considering how Red Mango is A LOT better AND cheaper, but too bad there's no branch near Champaign.) I think Cocomero recently raised its price. The last time I went there I spent $4 on a relatively small portion of ice cream. I don't understand why it's soo expensive. It's self-serve. There's one lady working at the cashier. There was no reason to raise the price besides greed, but since they have a monopoly on froyo in Champaign, I guess they can.    god damn I miss the classy Moonstruck.
v1Ee9uORpVNrNudX8MOB8A : To begin, no matter what you order, you get free soft-serve ice cream, so this place is golden to me.  This has become my new favorite place to eat when stuck in the barren wasteland that is College Park, MD.  Jason's replaced the old WaWa in the little shopping center off campus and is just excellent.    The menu is lengthy and makes decisions difficult, but the food is good.  Basic premise is get in line and then the food is brought to your table by number in the same fashion as Noodles & Co.  The salad bar comes at a nice price and can be ordered from a kiosk without ever getting in line.  I've tried the meatball po'boy and the ciabatta sandwich (not in the same sitting, I promise) and both were delicious.  One great thing about the menu is that a lot of it is customizable, so getting whatever you want is pretty easy.  Once the students get back in town, I imagine this place will become crazy busy.  However, having started out during the summer with low volume, I think they'll be ready for the crowds and there won't be much wait.  Oh, and did I mention they have free ice cream?
hmMCvs-wcfuiiFUtILH7Fw : I have to say I am totally impressed by the Galen Center. It's a very nicely designed moderately sized arena. Compared to the craphole gyms that the USC Womens Basketball and Volleyball teams had to play in, this is the Taj Mahal. Same can be said for the Mens Basketball team that had to play in the rat and roach infested Sports Arena.   The long running joke at USC was that an arena would never be built. For decades, when asked about one, USC personnel would just give a sarcastic chuckle. However they finally got it done, they did an awesome job. Nice unobstructed seating, everything looks clean for a Downtown LA establishment and  the HD video scoreboard that hangs over the court is incredibly clear and more colorful than real life. Nice cozy atmosphere, too.   From a photographic standpoint, I love it even more! Awesome lighting! The Long Beach Walter Pyramid is nice, but this is nicer and more intimate. Daytime games are limiting though. The one side of the court that faces the huge windows facing Downtown give a crazy glare! Conversely, shooting from that side is awesome!  Of course, with all good things, there is a negative. Parking is blows! When it takes 45 minutes to get out of the structure, there's no way you can find a positive about that. Add the maze-like and construction filled streets around the arena, it's a totally nightmare. It also costs at least $10.   Another plus to USC finally getting an arena is that UCLA is forced to step up it's game. Plans are in the works for finally upgrading Pauley Pavilion. Can't wait to see what those Westsiders come up with!
P5JbjrEu-sp6rud-jkQpkQ : This place is a bit overpriced and underwhelming. It has a comfortable atmosphere, but the coffee just isn't very good. I still come here once in a while because it's so convenient, but every time I do I go away wishing I had spent my money somewhere else. Once I got a latte and the milk was burnt! That was a big disappointment.
jlJqe0kAyj5VeOPuYOHygg : Went there yesterday. Good food, nice atmosphere and helpful waiters. Need I say more? I ordered the Sizzling Hot Bibimbap with beef bulgogi and it was really good. Everything was fresh, the meat was clean and well cooked and I just generally really liked the place. I would definitely recommend it.
F5O7OfYFHTiZB-cfynfC5g : Ever since going to college in Providence over a decade ago, I'm always going to have a soft spot for the Cable Car.  They've updated a few things.  Gotten rid of the ratty couches and the warped funny mirror near the entrance, but honestly, I miss those things.  All things change, I guess. Even though I live out of state now, I still try to make it down there to catch a film a couple of times a year.
2CDAYGPq6tgXTMyxkr2GNw : SUCH an upgrade from its days in the Garage - delicious, fresh, fast food. I've had great luck with their french fries, as well as their burgers (fresh, crispy grilled buns). While their less-than-healthy fare is quite good, the Asian chicken salad leaves a bit to be desired (weirdly salty). When they first opened up at their new location, I also was a HUGE fan of their milkshakes - always super thick and flavorful - but the last few times I've gone, I feel like I'm just drinking a chocolate milk (not quite the ideal milkshake experience). The frozen custard is pretty tasty though, especially with any of the toppings - I'd definitely go back for that alone.  I had trouble deciding on a star rating for this place, because a few recent experiences have been inconsistent from my earlier trips here (at the new location), but I'm still a faithful fan, and will continue to return for what I consider to be Harvard Square's freshest 'fast food.'
RJn0vpN_Alad9f2FTfaIMg : overrated. i had the chicken apple but couldn't taste the apple. not bad food, just expensive and less-than-filling.
1vlFsC9zr3UqTIFdtw_ETA : I've been to BWC twice this week for breakfast-- yes, its that good. Last Saturday, the boyfriend and I went to the BWC at First Colony for a late brunch. He got a breakfast burrito (which was just okay), and then proceeded to eat my delicious pico eggs benedict. Since he gobbled it up faster than I would have liked, I decided to repay BWC another visit with a less voracious friend.  The pico eggs benedict is aaaamazing! Definitely one of the best eggs benedicts I've had from a chain restaurant. On both occasions, the english muffin were crisp on the bottom, hot and soft on the inside, and delightfully buttery. On top of each muffin half sat a bed of sauteed spinach, fresh colorful pico, a nicely sized poached egg, and a smothering of savory hollandaise. The hollandaise had a great consistency and was so flavorful!  My friend ordered the original eggs benedict, which she liked as well. Both of our dishes came with diced potatoes with grilled peppers. They were just ok- a little on the greasy side.   The atmosphere is nice and cozy, with big couches tucked away in different corners. Definitely a great place to catch up with friends (while eating scrumptious egg benedicts...)!  *Quick disclaimer: at the Rice Village location, one of my eggs was not poached at all (no oozy yellow yolk, nothing), which was a huge disappointment, but I decided not to be an egg-snob that day.
9_j3O8_9hpY_HtOfwgyNLA : This is another wave for yogurt. The story goes like this....  The owner of pinkberry got the receipes of Red Mango and came to the US to expand her empire. Then, Red mango decided to show pinkberry who is the yogurt Queen, and opened up the first branch in Westwood to get some market share of those yogurt lovers.  It's super hard to find parking, so i am not sure how people can just get it quick and go. I assume they are targeting the UCLA students. It took me 20 mins to find parking, and the store is so small that i have to eat the yogurt in the car.   However, it's worth it because i finally have something to compare with. I wasn't sure if pinkberry is good because it's the only place i had tasted. I think pinkberry and Red manage is little similar but one is has less milky taste, and one has more.   Thanks to franchise power. One is opening in Culver city somewhere, so we won't have to just go around the circle to find parking. YAY!!!  i do like their yogurt, but their mochi is not as good as pinkberry.
78BLL7x0eCmpOtNmg1knmw : This Chipotle location is a nice and casual Mexican joint complete w/outdoor seating.  Pros:  - Quick service - Outdoor seating - Good food  Cons:  - Nothing  I can't speak for everybody because the only thing I ever get is the quesadillas (nice and fresh chicken which can sometimes be overcooked and good cheese) and the guac & chips (awesome).  One of the better chains I've had.
wsmGFgzk5_Hvk90v13tT-A : Wow. I know that they expect students to not have any idea what good food is but DAMN.. this place has to have the worst bbq I've ever tasted.. even the wanna-be BBQ in Europe is better than this crap. I got the chopped beef sandwich and lets just say that it should have been called the dry beef jerky sandwich. All the beef was as dry as grandma jennings and as chewy as my dog's rawhide. In fact I think my gums are bleeding from eating this bark-like sandwich.
PNX_yVsSq--DuYqG3tRLMA : Antico is by far the best pizza in Atlanta! The dough is just right and the ingredients are fresh. If you like deep dish Chicago-style pizza this isn't the place for you. The seating for this place can be challenging (it's a communal area). But with some patience, you can sit with some fun people or find a small corner to devour the tasty pizza. Oh and make sure you get a cannoli too! The place is also BYOB. So be sure and bring your favorite bottle of wine or six pack of beer.
XVvv0sULOT91E50E8-jmXg : We love this place!!! They serve both very Home-style Hong Kong Food, as well as very American Side!! I have never tried the Americanized Chinese Food. But my boyfriend's roommate love it and have it on a regular basis. So I think this place should be good.   So, as from Hong Kong, I can tell you that their Home-style Hong Kong dishes are really good and authentic....just like those you have it in Hong Kong....There are several items that me & my boyfriend like the most  No.1 Tomatoes Beef Egg with Tofu Rice It was really good, the sauce is clear not like brown sauce at all. But it is really tasty. The whole combination is very authentic. It is just too good with rice. I certainly recommend you to have it. I don't think is on the menu. Tofu is optional though.. either still taste good!!! Yet, it's more hearty to have tofu!!!  No.2 Stewed Pork Ribs Rice Again, this dish is very common in Hong Kong. They put Chinese miso paste in it (those black beans looking thing) just made is very favorable. They served with Chinese Veggie  No.2 Stewed Beef ____ Rice  Very common dish in Hong Kong. The beef is very tender and tasty. It's not like brown sauce. But it certainly very good!!!! =D  I think they stew it for quite a while   No.3 Za Cheung Min (Noodles with spicy ground pork and tofu.no soup.)  It's a little bit too oily because of the hot chili oil. There are lots of favors. The noodles doesn't taste anything. You have to mix the whole thing up together!! YumO~  For $3-4, you can get a hearty, fulfilling chinese meal!! YOU SHOULD GO !! =D  Try it out~~
7yozenv--JAEDIeF1e1aBA : Excellent service and they even stayed open past 5 for me to return my spin shoes because they were too small. They are so cool about it and said, "No worries". Great selection of cycle shoes and fab service
B742nrUUGlYGizbuE-TYeA : Went to visit my friend that gies to cal poly and he took us to this place. This is absolutely one of the best BBQ place I have ever been to. The tri tip sandwhich tasted fresh! Although their fries are pretty salty. The half chicken was actually an half of a chicken. Overall this place is definitely worth a shot. Minus 1 star for the salty ass fries.
oLHp2UHO6AX9He1hCgSgrQ : Everything I've had laundered or dry cleaned here has come back on time and looking good. Since not many folks come in, and she only runs the machine when she has full loads, I don't think they do the "in by 9 out by 5," stuff, but everything is usually ready within a day or two.   I'd give the place a 5, but it's kind of pricey. Located within spitting distance of the frats row and sororities, I'm sure she hikes up the margin for kids who don't ask about the prices, but if you ask nicely and talk to her she will give you a better rate.  Support a local business and come here instead of Zipps!
llXgzcqJ0npCmTz9BtgC2g : They have a great selection of breads, and baked desserts like cookies. Their "sugar cookies" are actually butter cookies. They had some cute little croissants when I was here.
R7QfDFN9RmKCV4KmiYe1Vw : This really is a 5 star establishment. I was introduced to Craigie (when it was still on Craigie St) by my former roommate who used to be a server there. Since that first amazing experience, I've been back for a birthday meal with my parents, a birthday dinner with my girlfriend, a Chef's whim experience with roommates, and most recently, brunch yesterday. Each of these meals has been nothing short of incredible, and all shared the extreme satisfaction with the food, top notch service, and leaving the restaurant knowing that the money spent (while expensive) was well worth it.  Dinner is a meal that is always awesome at Craigie. It's definitely the least economical offering they have, but you need to eat right? Ranging from a la carte meals to a prix fixe and a tasting menu, the choices really depend on how hungry you are and how much you care to spend. Obviously, the more food you get, the happier you are going to be, because all of the parts of the meal are executed incredibly well, each course is better than the next.  The Chef's Whim menu (I think it's just on Sunday nights at this point) is an awesome way to taste really good food at a more affordable price for a prix fixe. You don't know what you're going to get for your three courses, you just know that it's going to be awesome. The only thing the server asks when you order the Chef's Whim is if you have any allergies, other than that the meal consists of whatever the Chef wants to make. It can involve parts of animals you wouldn't otherwise try, which makes it a delicious, adventurous event!  Brunch yesterday was awesome. The coffee was flowing - delicious and strong. The bloody mary was spice well with fresh horseradish. I got the hash - made from beef cheek and beef tongue with a poached farm fresh egg. Just incredible. My girlfriend decided she was more in the mood for lunch and went with the burger. What can you say about a burger that amazing? I can't really put it into words, other than saying it was amazing! Check out Boston Burger Blog's Rich C,'s review for a better description than I can give the burger justice (http://www.yelp.com/biz/craigie-on-main-cambridge#hrid:DwJwPOolwMb_MhAQHV5odQ).  The best advice I can give about Craigie on Main is to make a reservation, and go hungry!
etZHdT6t8NUntv6hTGooCQ : My sister loves taking me out to eat, and this is one of the places that she took me.  I absolutely loved their crispy rice cake. It was very tasty. It'd have been perfect if it was more spicy, but that's just my preference.  I heard that they are popular with the tofu pocket but I wasn't impressed with it.  I also ordered some bulgolgi and it was extremely salty. I can't even recall how many cups of water I drank after that...  The service was okay. There were two waitresses who seemed very busy even though there were only 2-3 tables. I guess they had a lot of tasks.   Anyway, I would only come back for the rice cakes.
NATftbpIjkZHy0PN4ZGh9A : My husband and I really like it here.  The food is good, I wouldn't say great or outstanding but definately good.  We really like the sangria and love that you are able to order it by the pitcher wich is a good deal (under $20 for a huge pitcher). They have good chips and salsa and the service has always been perfect.
26WePdMt_GQuMZGfSCTmPQ : When I read the positive reviews on Yelp, I expected to fall in love with Bevier Cafe.  After going to Bevier Cafe yesterday with a couple of friends, the good news is that I don't dislike the place.  We arrived a few minutes before the cafe closed, and they were out of some of their entrees.  The food we got seemed to have been sitting out for a while, and it wasn't as tasty as I anticipated.  Also, their service seems kind of disorganized--you take a tray, tell the people at the counter what you want, pay for it, go sit down with an empty tray, and then the employees bring you your food.  Couldn't they just hand the food over the counter?  Or just have real servers?    Even with the not-as-good-as-expected food and the confusing service, I like the concept of Bevier Cafe.  I'm happy to support a student/university-run restaurant, and I will eat there again.
z_iG1pIxiIeNBZ7VnWtznQ : By non-CU standards, this is perfectly reasonable Thai food in a pleasant order at-the-counter setting.   By CU standards, it's the best Asian place in town near as I can tell; it's better than Siam Terrace, anyway.   Prices are reasonable, and the vegetarian dishes (which is all I've had) have many vegetables not just no meat.  One weakness: they are sadly lacking an eggplant dish.
sMwaexsG18eq5bW5WihsRA : Near the Carnegie Mellon Campus, PHI Bar is the  only place I have ever encountered a "pitcher of shots".  Since you gotta know, it's a 12 ounce beer glass full of liquor with like 2 ice cubes and a strainer on top.  I still remember those hangovers.
LJz3CvHg4dg3kHL78YS7xA : Coming from a stint in the West Coast where great Mexican food is abundant, Carrburritos did not disappoint. Yes, Chipotle is good, but there's something to be said about a great local burrito place that gets it right. I highly recommend the Carnitas or Chorizo burrito, and pay a little extra to get 'all flour' chips instead of the mix. The portions are great, and while some gripe about price on here, you don't get a better deal for your money. Oh and try something new besides your run of the mill pico de gallo; with all of there salsa flavors available, stretch yourself and go for the verde or the frutas.  What's keeping it from 5 stars? Mainly the parking and seating, and sometimes the unpleasant staff. Don't go at lunch time either, because you'll wait 30 minutes for a burrito. Other than that, eat on.
jC4M7BbXaFMlUG4RXhixwA : This restaurant is my least favorite in the world, including places I haven't even been to yet.  The owners/"visionaries" presuppose that, because they don't specify which "border" the venue's name references (or on which side of said border said cafe resides), they can combine Tex-Mex (it isn't Mexican) dishes (this definitely isn't food) with "Cajun" or "Creole" dishes, yet refuse to serve simple, common dishes that would blend right in with the rest of the stereotypical menu.  Case in point: Nachos.    The Border Cafe staff will not under any circumstances serve you nachos.  This past Friday night, I was denied nachos while simultaneously being assured that the chefs in back knew how to make them--they just don't, because Border Cafe is "unique" (the waiter's phrasing, not mine).    Instead, I was told to order three very overpriced appetizers in order to make my own nachos at the table.  I did so, ate about a fourth of all of the ingredients [I compiled myself], and felt ill for a day and a half.    It is my most sincere hope that other restaurants don't follow suit and attempt to redefine 'uniqueness' in favor of disappointing customers on both conceptual and concrete levels alike.
2efNzNg_UkElPpr5UCXrhw : A weird little Berkeley theme place, which almost but not quite works. The idea is that you can come here and frame your artwork, poster, whatever yourself. But the truth is you don't really do it yourself, they do everything and you assemble it. Woo woo, its really no big deal. If you don't know any thing about framing and you want to pretend like you do Great! Otherwise, you'll be scratching your head. The prices are about the same as having some else do it for you.
P0w1ufYW-2mm29EEAdVbrw : Best in the world! Just look at the pictures someone posted. I always get the dogs with ketchup and mustard. Classic. Those dogs have "snap" the buns are steamed, the view to the flattop grill is medieval.  Once I saw some boxes in the alley and thought I found the secret to making these at home. Nope. These ingredients are made just for Gus's.
CGhvAZIFlEgn-4KlB7D2Pg : (This review applies to both Aladdins.)  I'm not the sort of person who often customizes a food order, especially at a small place like this. And yet, my opinion of the Aladdins has gone way up since I started ordering things without lettuce. Iceberg lettuce tastes like water, and makes everything it comes into contact with taste like water.  Aladdin is not a place you come to for authentic Middle Eastern or Mediterranean food. The chicken shawarma is called 'shish taouk' in the other branch, but isn't really recognizable as either dish. The yoghurt-based sauce in the gyro contained no detectable trace of cucumber, so I can't in good conscience refer to it as tzatziki. Still, the important thing is that everything I've tried here was consistently at least good, and sometimes excellent. Their recipes may be unconventional, but they work well.
5ldUDMD8-BiLPl-pXSZIqA : I have no real complaints about the Globe - I've actually always had pretty good experiences here.  However, I have avoided it in the evenings and have mainly frequented it for weekend brunch and once for late lunch.  I like their brunch - all the dishes I have tried have been very good and they have some good brunch drinks.  I have tried the lemon & ricotta pancakes (delicious), the zucchini & goat cheese frittata (very good), and the brioche French toast (also very good), along with the side of bacon and the latke with apple butter, both of which I enjoyed but I probably liked the bacon more than the latke.  I am not sure if they still do it, but they had a brunch special which included a beverage (I think a mimosa or a bloody Mary or something else) and it was a slightly better deal than ordering everything individually.  We once had a pretty large party here for a birthday brunch celebration and they handle us really well.  For the late lunch, I drank some frou-frou cocktails, which were good, and also had a really good sandwich.  And, I saw Nomar Garciaparra and Mia Hamm eating here, so that was cool.  I have occasionally felt that our particular server was a little clueless here but they have always been nice and friendly and fast.  So, I like the Globe.
xisRIAVE_SZGUbS4G9JV_A : Definitely not impressed - dirty water glasses, slow service, bland food, greasy pastries, and an up-charge to substitute salad for fries.  The salad ended up being one of those pre-washed bags of romaine and was dumped in my plate sans dressing. With salad, my crappy, tasteless chicken sandwich ended up costing $18. I would definitely avoid this place.
KC-D5rknDOPBC8Tzn9IQKA : Picture it: New Year's Eve 2008. You just moved back to Cali after four years in Philly and Austin. Dick Clark's wishing Ryan Seacrest a Happy New Year, and you've consumed crazy amounts of champagne, enough to (supposedly) knock a girl off her chair. You pass out in your friends' guest room at 12:30. and wake up at 9 a.m., still a wee bit tipsy. Good times.  How to kick off the New Year right? With your first In-N-Out burger - fried onions, no lettuce, X-well fries - in four years, of course. This Westwood location was on our way home.  I hate to say it, but I almost knocked a star off for the ridiculously long drive-through line, but that's not In-N-Out's fault. Or is it? If they didn't make their burgers so deliciously good, all those people nursing New Year's Day hangovers wouldn't be there. Right?   After reading everyone else's comments, I'm starting to think it's this particular location, but I'll give 'em the extra star since I'd been waiting so long.
nGIO9M_Le_tOTtzVjfC0Uw : An exemplary Pinkberry.   Helpful, charming staff and lively, interesting crowd. They play good music and it's always really cold in there which is great.
BGpJRlE9RijT0EZS0n23fQ : Excellent Northern Indian cuisine. They serve many of the typical entrees expected but with a different twist, yielding dishes that are rich and somehow more flavorful. There is a distinct quality to their food that puts them above many restaurants with the same items. Portions are hearty and have the option of small and large sizes for entrees and prices are more reasonable than average. Main dishes come with rice.  The restaurant is mostly for carry out and delivery with just a few tables and chairs available. Located conveniently near the CMU and Pitt campuses, their entrees are worth the walk over to try out.
dA1yZpIteWlOeXzEpk8Ycg : Slumber: Fantastic... i've been travelling a lot lately and I love the beds at Residence Inn. This one does not disappoint and the number and variety of pillows makes it easy to find what you need for a good night sleep.  Squeaky Clean: Bathroom was top notch, as was the rest of the room.   Girl Stuff: For a travelling girl who needs to look good before a presentation, the abundance of mirrors and good lighting, great water pressure in the shower and full size hair dryer was very much appreciated.  Caffeine: Complimentary Coffee and Tea practically all day!  GPS: Great location within walking distance of MIT, awesome places to eat, the train, and a plethora of cabbies ready to take you to the airport.  Front Desk Time: the gentleman who checked me in was beyond courteous and even let me check in early.
FhAHuOR32hG0mfT2kSeZ4g : $17.50 for a small pastrami and swiss on rye that came with no swiss? Are you kidding, Jerry? In this economy you charge and arm and a leg for a mediocre slice of dry meat on so-so bread? And what was with the rude, condescending girl who took my order? When I got home and discovered the Swiss had not been put in, I called the deli. The girl said I ordered no such thing.  Gee, my favorite sandwich for over 40 years and today I forgot to mention Swiss...really? Her atitude is pathetic and her treatment of customers--especially when they over-pay for under-achieved food--is amazing considering this economy.  Shame on Jerry's Deli...shame on that girl, too.
dc_1nA00gJGuOXBiCRcO7Q : The wait was longer than what the hostess indicated.  We waited for about an hour when it was suppose to be only 15 mins.  Please arrive early and allot ample waiting time and prepare for current patrons dining to lounge around and extend your waiting time.  The pizzas were excellent however the extreme long wait (longer than what the hostess tells you) soured our night and we did not enjoy our meal despite the food being somewhat delicious.  I've had better pizza.   Also it's not large-group friendly.  Alvin's Tri-Scale Rating (AT-SR): Food: 2 of 5 Service: 2 of 5 Ambiance: 2 of 5
ul5VWhO-pW7gUuI7vYJ2-Q : It was a bad night at Friday's, but not because of Friday's. We didn't plan to go there, so I didn't print the coupon I'd been emailed.  But then I remembered I could access it on my phone.  No problem, said the very accommodating waitress.    So my daughter and I ordered Long Island Iced Teas and two entrees, plus a kid's meal for the little guy.  The little guy, who'd been somewhat catatonic during the previous gig at Trader Joe's, wasn't any more alert at Friday's, and ignored his crayons and coloring placemat.  The second the food was placed on the table, he suddenly tossed his cookies!  So much for a nice, relaxing dinner.  I can't praise the waitress enough for her quick and efficient action, bringing tons of napkins and a big plastic bag for cleaning up the mess, packing up our stuff to go, and getting us the check quickly.  The real kick in the pants was when she regretfully told me that the phone coupon was no good:  it was valid only if we'd ordered appetizers along with our entrees.  I guess two stiff drinks and a kid's meal wasn't enough.  Not her fault - the computer wouldn't accept the code.  By the time we got home, the food was cold, and my pasta and chicken bruschetta dish, which probably would have been good if eaten when served, didn't benefit from the microwave, which turned the pasta to mush.  And the child?  As soon as we got home he started turning cartwheels, with no evidence whatsoever of the dinner crisis.  That's kids for you!
8_IFHys-6dwyY0vcKxKD0g : I've stopped by here twice for a breakfast taco before my classes. The lady is sweet and the breakfast tacos are delicious.   I've had the egg and chorizo and the egg and spinach. Both were yummy in the tummy. She makes it on the spot when you order. Half the fun is watching her cook your breakfast taco on the hibachi grill. I'm licking my lips, going "oh boy oh boy", while clenching onto my $2 enjoying the aromas and watching the egg and chorizo sizzle on the grill.   I can never eat another breakfast taco from Jack in the Box or McDonalds again.
_ekZ5HFbKHAADBUHqn6sUw : Many of my UCLA friends rave about this place bc it is delicious and close to campus, so I figured that I would try it out. I was visiting a friend and we stopped here for lunch.  The place was nice, small and clean.   I ordered just a basic cheese pizza.  The crust is pretty thin, mmmm. The flavor was pretty good, BUT not great and the pizza was wayyyy too greasy. The sauce lacked that punch of seasonings. I LOVE greasy anything, trust me, but this was a bit much. I took a bite, okay, not bad. I take a second bite while a large group of people walk by and just my luck, large drops of oil come rolling down my chin. Embaresssssssssssssssssinnnnnnggg. Who cares? I dont know them. So i go for my third bite, outstretched, careful not to spill onto myself and again, I can taste the grease as it coats the roof of my mouth  :(.   I won't be back, but if you enjoy really greasy pizza, I recommend this place.
569wJ4eGhFefFqT36bXyUg : I like Pinkberry. Their salted caramel yogurt is awesome, and I'm not sure I care to try any of their other flavors, given how good it is. I love the fact that you can get as many toppings as you want, for one price. This is how toppings should be everywhere! And they have mochi!  But here are my hangups. It's too pricey, and the prices grow exponentially with the sizes - so I stick to small. It's not local, and is potentially taking business away from our own homegrown Berryline (which, granted, has a limited yogurt flavor selection, and charges per topping). There's always a gigantic line, and the employees have a confusing serving setup that doesn't help things along. Plus they don't fill the yogurt cup very well - I thought it was just me, but it sounds like everyone always finds that big empty hole in the center.
ZiA15ifrQJR0v30MVgw-VA : Gould Dermatology is great!  My husband and I both drive to Palo Alto from SF to see Elizabeth Gould for all our dermatology needs -- from the minor-but-annoying, to the cosmetic (ipl treatments), to the "do I need to worry about this?".  The staff are friendly; the office runs smoothly and appointments are punctual; and Dr. Gould is a real pleasure to see! She is professional, effective, attentive, friendly, kind and efficient.  She listens, and she is clear and instructive about options, treatments, and expected results.  And my skin looks amazing, thanks to a few non-invasive ipl treatments!
B-glFJIH9WJIa0jCL6I8jA : Midcity's patio was my remote office for the better part of satuirday afternoon.  Most table-service restos would not tolerate a lingerer who just stuck with iced coffees once I finished my sandwich - this place encouraged it.  It's definitely a cafe' - the food options are good, but limited. The drink options are more plentiful and varied.  Free wi-fi and friendly service (beyond not kicking my sorry butt to the curb) wraps up just a perfect spot.....and exactly what I wish my hometown had.
Jv-tenKXbPKCOR5sIeLsrw : Had the Tuscan Chicken Sandwich, coffee, and a strawberry croissant. I sat outside and people watched. Food was good. Sandwich was warm w/ chicken busting out of both ends. Coffee was hot and strong. Strawberry croissant was soft, not chewy. The line was out the door but moved quickly, like Portos.  I'd go again, if I'm ever back in the area.
3IrLADMpodifKJmqPO3C5Q : What can I possibly say to describe Harry's Chocolate Shop?  Harry's makes you feel like a real Boilermaker. The true, honest meaning of a Purdue Boilermaker, long before it was just a shot dropped into a beer.   Now I've never been the school spirited type. I was into dyeing my hair purple, being angry at my parents, punk music, and Star Wars in high school, not excatly the prototype for cheery school spirit. I have to admit, I was wary of going to Harry's my first time, but Harry's became my favorite bar on Purdue's campus.   Harry's does not have drink specials, and they will laugh at you when you ask. Just know that they have mixed drinks for $3.75, and they are STRONG. Harry's has the biggest pitchers on campus, and the nicest bartenders once you get to know them. Free popcorn at night, and don't even think about trying to write on the walls anymore. You'd have to be *wink-wink* super sneaky to write the address of your crew house on the wall by the smoking lounge exit.   Harry's has amazing chili, and if you ever find yourself with a break between classes, don't hesitate to grab some.   Harry's gets really packed on game days, Breakfast Club days, weekends, and Thursday nights. The jukebox plays the same music every day, and you would look dumb not to join in during the chorus of "Sweet Caroline." No matter how cool, you are, the atmosphere takes over, and you well up with Purdue Pride.  I wish there were more places I could feel at home in like I do at Harry's.
_23BwlxO__eFy0LtcrgNzg : I hate to write a one-star review, but this place totally deserves it for the service.  I went here with a friend on a Thursday night around 9 p.m., and the place was moderately busy, but nothing crazy.  We placed our order and it literally took 45 minutes for our food to arrive.    The main problem was that our server was completely lost.  She basically forgot to pickup our order for so long that they had to reheat it and give it to us.  There was another table that came in 25 minutes later than us, and they got their food faster, even though we were a party of 2 and they were a party of 5, and it was the SAME server.     The server never came back to refresh our drinks, it was only until we told a bus-boy, that we got our drinks refilled.    I am sure this isn't a typical night, but I can't excuse the fact that the place was not that busy, and our server basically messed up, and never apologized.  We were going to complain to the manager, but honestly were too tired of the whole ordeal to say anything.  Will definitely not come back here again.
VPg3pVBdxmdlitf3Ma2YtA : One of great buildings in the world.  A pair of lungs inspired the conceptual design of massing for this building.  All the Corbu's design principles are incorporated throughout in the aesthetic and function of public and private spaces.  During hot summer a nice breeze of air passing through the bris soleil and floor to ceiling window.  A pleasant and inspiring studio/work space.... (in memory of the late Prof. Szabo).
XjhQry1p89bKNQtzhNO0ng : BEER. Reasonably priced, and the menu is organized by type of beer (Ales, Pale Ales, Belgian, etc.) with fantastic little descriptions for each.  According to my brother, who goes to UPenn and goes here at least once a week, the beer selection changes all the time. He's never had the same beer twice.  Things we drank: Elysian Bete Blanche (perfect, amazing, my favorite kind of Belgian) Dogfish Head 90 minute IPA (safe, but good choice for my brother, who had never had Dogfish Head before)  Flight containing: Duck Rabbit Barleywine Duvel Green Six Point Sweet Action (I want to drink this all the time, and living in NYC, I most likely can) Victory Dark Lager  I love the little tasting note sheets they give you when you order a flight. I can never remember the names of beers I like after a couple decent ones.  We didn't have any food, and were lucky enough to get a seat at the bar on a Friday night. Not too loud, great for having conversations over some excellent beers. And apparently you can bring growlers here.
0fwB90nuH-SSEj0jSEfr2A : 4 stars if you can get in. 0 stars if you can't. guess is that if you try to come here often enough the overall rating will get very close to 0 without actually hitting 0 (remember that Monday night at the bar? yeah that was awesome).  ridiculous door policy as everyone has mentioned. if there were 500 playmates staying here on the same night and they had replaced every toilet with a suitcase full of gold bricks, the security would still be too tight. but once in you know what - the bar is pretty cool, as you would suspect. and the scenery is ridiculous. i don't mean to be that guy but if you were from out of town and you only went to the bar at the W someone could tell you that beautiful women grow on trees in LA and you'd probably believe them.
gSihkk-3VA74GwmiNreNfg : My girlfriend introduced me to bubble tea a little over two years ago. Before this time, I was just a unlearned hick from Yuckima, WA. (we only had one place in town that served it)  Well, now fast forward two years...........I love bubble tea! (I don't love the 'bubbles', though-no tapioca for this hombre! I don't drink it as much as I'd like to, but I'm sure in all it's sugary goodness that's not an entirely bad thing.  Back to the point: WOW is my favorite bubble tea place in Seattle-why? Because it's cool to hang out there-(well lit, clean), they have a fecal matter-load of choices, and it's a good value! Yeah, they do love Jesus (the radio is turned on to christian music, the prayer on the wall), but they aren't kidnapping and imprisoning you, they aren't trying to convert you.................................................or ARE they? (with their tea! =) )
N2p3DF5njj6wz_XtIjcB9g : This is a mom & pop run place.  I had the carnitas burrito & I thought that it could have been more flavorful than what I had.  For the price, I expected 50% more burrito.  But heck the economy is bad.
IhQsZebG5b2MLcadP1Tktw : My eyebrows love riya.   My wallet does not love riya. What can i say, I've been spoiled for many years with $3 deals on eyebrow threading in Socal's little India.  But...I'll still be going back, as my eyebrows still be growing.
DAPBo6sh_sstohVUz0yS8Q : Man, the place was packed on a Thursday at 12:30pm. Not sure being on St Pattie's Day and the first day of the NCAA adds how many standard deviations to the norm. We had to take the last two spots by the bar counter. Ordered the Calamari, Mongolian Beef, and Orange Shrimp from the pre-fix. Food is consistently a little heavy (in both taste and look). This is definitely not a place for either fresh catch from the tank or thousand year old egg.
Z6bv-BfHBiaFZGXnwXw6cQ : Had the unfortunate opportunity of having to look for a new place for a smog check when my mechanic's smog checking machine broke down. Found this place in a search with good reviews and that $29.99 coupon from smogtips.com. It's a very small hidden place located behind the car wash--you have to drive around the back of the car wash to find it. It's basically the test bay and a tiny office. The technician was quiet but seemed to know exactly what he was doing. He was finishing up a test right before me, and even with that I think it took longer to get my car washed afterward. The coupon came with a free exterior car wash. Overall, I'll probably be back, especially when the DMV starts requiring a "test only" site for my car. Great experience. I've been to much worse places. Happy customer here!
2aToqozQ2NKYN9YaoSj0bg : Not tart enough but creamy.
IdME_E8z_uHFa4CVUg3vEw : Noodles are pretty easy to make, but sometimes you just need a cheap, big lunch. Lulu's is the place for that. Sure, I can make better noodle dishes myself--but can I do it on my lunch break?  I have had both the Pad Thai and the Singapore Curry Noodles. What they lack in authenticity they make up in volume! I really enjoyed both dishes. There are vegetarian options for almost everything--you can get tofu instead of meat. The Szechuan green beans also look good, and I plan on getting that next time.  Do not go expecting a great "restaurant experience." It's a very loud undergraduate-infested type of place. This is a delight best sampled between classes or as takeout.  The lunch specials are very reasonably priced, and I plan to take advantage.
j4gfQQm1nCPD-Q_W-I_vlg : First off -- this is a review solely based on their cocktails. I showed up too late to try anything from their kitchen, so that will have to wait.  I finally found a place that takes cocktail-making seriously. A place that stocks several kinds of bitters and knows how to use them; a place that infuses their syrups for an extra layer of flavor; a place that knows how to use ice (so rare to find a place that understands the importance of good ice); a place where bartenders understand their role as performers and magicians behind the bar.  I can't say anything about their food, but you'd be crazy not to try their cocktails. Unbelievable stuff, and friendly service. Tip heavy, because you'll want to come back!
lRd75GiC-WQB-_bhkjW0qw : Well, what can I say about this spot. I'll start with the positives and say the atmosphere is really cool, great place to hangout if you just want to chillax and socialize. Now for the slippery downside of the Rocky Mountain, the customer service was ridiculously terrible which I knew would be from the start when my server stood at my table and yawned in my face before she introduced herself and proceeded to tell my peeps and I how she couldn't wait to get to bed. Can you say WTF! She was nice to say the least, but was very slow to respond to us, forgot to bring us condiments and straw's plus we had to ask two other servers to get our server's attention because she rarely stopped by to see if we needed anything. The pizza was alright, it more than likely would've tasted better had it not been cold and the wings were the highlight...pretty damn good. Long story short, needless to say I've had better and will not recommend this place to anyone for the exception of  drinks and atmosphere with zero expectations for good food or good customer service.
koukWWr0l9nij4PuAGAWyQ : I stayed in this hotel from Tues-Thurs and got a room with a king sized bed.  The amenities were nice: bath & body works aromatherapy shampoo/conditioner/lotion/soap.  (I'm always a sucker for those things.)  The tv was new- flat screen.  The bed was soft and heavenly.  My shower also had two shower heads- fancy.  The bedside lamps had extra electric outlets on them so I didn't have to hunt for plugs for my phone charger and laptop.  The Kendall/MIT T-station is right outside the lobby.  On the downside, parking is $23/night, there is no complimentary breakfast (although a Starbucks and food court exists downstairs), the bathroom countertop is tiny, and internet is $13/day.  The room itself was also very pricey.  The price wasn't really my concern because my company chose the hotel and paid for it, so I definitely enjoyed my stay.  However, would I come here on my own?  Probably not, simply because of all the extra pricing.  Grand total for my stay was $880 for 3 nights, not including the price for parking.  This is just hotel room + internet fees.
sYIOguQLTcdZxrlMvmFXrQ : MMMMMM NAM NAM NAM! ;)   I loooove thai places, so I feel a bit biased but... I LOOVED IT HERE. We had Tom yum soup and Phad see eew. The noodles in our Phad see eew was a bit undercooked but it was still delish. ATE IT ALL. and the tom yum soup was some of the best i've ever tasted. Although my hot date got sick from it being too spicey. But hey, I enjoyed it. :)  OH! and they only accept cash after 10pm!
cp5zEuDGEECNqn-VpuYwPQ : Finally, decent Indian food on the West Side!  This is mostly a takeout place. We did eat at the restaurant, but there are only a few small tables. We ate outside and we were approached by a panhandler who asked us to buy him a meal. (I bared my teeth and belted him with a piece of chicken and he quickly scurried off).  We ordered Chicken Tikka (chicken in tomato cream sauce) and Palaak Paneer (curried spinach with fresh cheese). Each dish came with 2 large pieces of delicious butter naan bread - flaky and decadent! Both dishes were really good. Very rich and spicy.  We will be dining here again, and soon.
ikbe4G5yDTG0Eq8stq8gtw : Went on a Saturday night. First time there. Diverse crowd. All ages, shapes, sizes, and colors. I like that. Great music. Weird bathrooms, I had to peer closely to determine which was the best fit for me. Trippy decor- like it!
XlWRvMOdoXKbunnbq0C50A : yummy food.  especially loved the 10 buffet for lunch.  I prefer parus indian place, but this place is good too when parus is closed and youre craving indian around noon.  will come back again for sure to try out their dinner.
14YZEpAXF98wlApoEkVvQA : The food was amazing. My wife says it was the best lobster bisque she's ever had (better than the soup she got at McCormick and Smicks a few weeks ago). The service was fair and that is pulling the rating down- Are they not allowed to pour our wine for us at a BYOB? (never had to pour my own first glass at any restaurant). The fish was beautifully grilled and tasted fantastic.
V2t4ZhhTHqXwwqL0PhSFBQ : The owner, refuses to reimburse his customers when his dryers burn your clothes. I have lost $300 worth on high thread count sheets because random dryers are calibrated too high. The owner is cheap, so he is unwilling to pay for the regular maintenance of his dryers. Beware! Either the dryers are broken, too cold or too hot.
