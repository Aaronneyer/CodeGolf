***Code Golf***

This code was originally written for a Code Golf competition put on near the end
of my Freshman year of college, which was right after I had started learning
Ruby. There weren't too many people competing, but 4 people got correct
solutions, and I had the shortest (And 3rd fastest).

Summer 2013 I looked back over my solution, and corrected many mistakes made as
a beginning Ruby programmer. You can see the recent fixes in commit `47de32`
